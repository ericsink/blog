<P>When we talk about <A 
href="Marketing_for_Geeks.html">Marketing for 
Geeks</A>, we obviously talk a lot about marketing.&nbsp; But we also need to 
talk about geeks.&nbsp; After all, we chose software as our primary career 
field, and that choice says something about the way we are wired inside.&nbsp; 
When we do coding or design, that wiring is a strength, but it can be a weakness 
when we start getting involved in marketing.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>What do customers 
want?</FONT></P>
<P>To be a successful <A 
href="Small_ISV_Defined.html">small ISV</A>, you 
have to build a product that your customers want.&nbsp; Sounds easy, 
right?&nbsp; But how do we know what they want?</P>
<P>Actually there are lots of ways to figure out what a market wants, none of 
which are terribly accurate,&nbsp;most of which are quite expensive.&nbsp; In 
the end, we can spend lots of time and money and still we have no guarantees. 
Wouldn't it be easier if our prospective customers just happened to want the 
same things that we want?&nbsp; Then we could simply build products for 
ourselves, comfortably assured that other people will like them as much as we 
do.</P>
<P>A friend of mine wants to sell a cool technology solution to the trucking 
industry.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he is a geek.&nbsp; He realized right away that 
it was going to be nearly impossible to sell technology to trucking companies 
unless he understood trucking.&nbsp; So he went to truck driving school.&nbsp; 
He got his truck drivers license.&nbsp; He got a job driving a load of paper 
every day between Chicago and Peoria.&nbsp; He got layed-off.&nbsp; He bought 
his own truck.&nbsp; He started his own freight company.&nbsp; His product idea 
is getting better because he is learning what the people in his market really 
need.</P>
<P>This&nbsp;approach may seem extreme, but it's a great example of an important 
concept:&nbsp; It is <EM>much</EM> easier to sell products to people who are not 
so different from yourself.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>However...</FONT></P>
<P>... although being similar to your customers is a powerful advantage, it 
is&nbsp;not enough.&nbsp; Your own preferences will never be an exact match for 
the wants of your market segment.</P>
<P>This is true even here at SourceGear.&nbsp; We are a company of software 
developers, selling tools for use by other software developers.&nbsp; Can a 
small ISV and its customers possibly be any more similar?&nbsp; It seems like 
our preferences should be a perfect match for the preferences of people in our 
market, but it just doesn't work out that way.&nbsp; We regularly hear from 
people who are trying to use our products in ways that never occurred to us.</P>
<P>If&nbsp;a developer tools company&nbsp;can see the gap between&nbsp;ourselves 
and our customers, think how much bigger that gap must be in any other 
market.&nbsp; </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Getting Fooled by the Early 
Adopters</FONT></P>
<P>All too often, companies learn this lesson as they lie dead at the bottom of 
the <A href="Act_Your_Age.html">chasm</A>.&nbsp; 
Because of the way markets are divided into stages, it sometimes <EM>seems</EM> 
like our customers actually do have the same preferences that we do.</P>
<P>In every&nbsp;market, the first stage is the Early Adopters.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot 
of these people are geeks, just like we are.&nbsp; If we build a product to 
match our own preferences, the Early Adopters might actually buy it, since 
they're not altogether different from us.&nbsp; We might even start to believe 
that we've built a great product which will be popular with the mainstream 
customers on the other side of the chasm.&nbsp; If so, we are in for a big 
shock.</P>
<P>This effect is perhaps most visible by cruising around the <A 
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</A> website.&nbsp; There are 
thousands of small open source projects there, most of which have very few 
developers and very few users.&nbsp; Typically an open source project begins 
when a developer wants to "scratch his own itch".&nbsp; He creates an app for 
himself, specifically designed to solve&nbsp;some problem he is 
experiencing.&nbsp; He makes his app open source and expects hordes of people to 
start downloading it.&nbsp; A few people do notice the app and discover it is 
exactly what they were looking for.&nbsp; But the hordes don't come.&nbsp; There 
is a big differences between solving your own problems and solving mainstream 
problems.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Gauntlets of Fumbling</FONT></P>
<P>To reach mainstream customers, we sometimes need to ignore our own 
preferences and just do what the customers want.&nbsp; Non-geeks in marketing 
generally have no trouble with this.&nbsp; Once they decide what the market 
prefers, all they want to do is get that product into the customer's 
hands.&nbsp; They don't have strong opinions about technology, so they don't 
have trouble separating customer preferences from their own.</P>
<P>Not so with us geeks.&nbsp; We care too much about technology.&nbsp; We chose 
software development careers because we love technology for its own sake.&nbsp; 
We fight amongst ourselves in religious battles that seem arcane and irrelevant 
to normal people.&nbsp; We debate vi against emacs, Linux against Windows, C# 
against Java, RSS against Atom.&nbsp; We have strong opinions and we make them 
visible to everyone around us.</P>
<P>And when we get involved in marketing, we can stumble over those opinions. We 
need to talk about what customers want, but our own preferences get in the 
way.&nbsp; We bring our technology prejudices and biases to the discussion, 
often&nbsp;without ever being aware of the problems they can cause.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The whole situation is like wearing Gauntlets of Fumbling.&nbsp; Remember <A 
href="http://www.nethack.org/">NetHack</A>?&nbsp; If your character is wearing 
these useless gloves, everything is more difficult.&nbsp; A similar effect 
happens when we bring our weird technology opinions into a discussion about what 
customers want.&nbsp; We slow everything down, and we make the whole process 
very clumsy.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>During the Q&amp;A part of my talk at <A 
  href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</A>, somebody asked me why anyone 
  would buy <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</A> when 
  <A href="http://www.cvsnt.org/">CVS</A> is available for free.&nbsp; This 
  question is a great example of the need to learn how to see through the eyes 
  of customers.&nbsp; It comes from someone who sees CVS as sufficient, who 
  cannot imagine paying money for anything else.</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>And yet, people <EM>do</EM> buy commercial version control tools.&nbsp; In 
  fact, I can name at least a dozen version control vendors which I believe are 
  profitable.&nbsp; The aggregate annual revenue in this market segment is a 
  nine digit number.</P>
  <P>An explanation of why all this revenue can coexist with an open source 
  alternative is beyond the scope of this article.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that 
  if you are completely bewildered at the fact that anyone uses commercial 
  tools, then you might want to find a scroll of identify and see what kind of 
  gloves you are wearing.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>In a recent design meeting here at SourceGear, we talked about the 
  possibility of adding <A href="http://www.passport.com/">Passport</A> login 
  features to Vault.&nbsp; One of the developers grimaced, shivered and said, 
  "Passport makes my skin crawl".&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>This guy brings a negative bias about Passport into the discussion.&nbsp; 
  Perhaps he got his opinions from stuff he sees in the press or on 
  Slashdot.&nbsp; Perhaps those negative opinions are justified.&nbsp; But if a 
  substantial fraction of our target market wants Vault to understand Passport 
  authentication, we need to lay our bias aside and investigate the issue 
  objectively.&nbsp; Our biases don't help us figure out how to make the best 
  product for the market.&nbsp; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>I'm preaching this sermon to myself, as my own history is littered with 
  examples of me trying to build the product I wanted.&nbsp; I've had the 
  experience of building an app that I thought was <I>so</I> cool, only to 
  realize later that nobody else thought the coolness was quite so 
evident.</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <UL>
    <LI>Our SourceOffSite Collab product was heavily affected by my own 
    religious technology opinions.&nbsp; Our users do like the product, but we 
    invested a lot of effort under the hood in things that don't benefit the 
    user at all.<BR><BR>
    <LI>Even Vault has suffered from my mistakes.&nbsp; As a result of my 
    advocacy, the label feature&nbsp;in Vault&nbsp;is somewhat different from 
    its SourceSafe counterpart.&nbsp; Our design is more "neato", but quite a 
    few of our users really wish we had just done plain-old-boring 
    SourceSafe-style labels.</LI></UL>
  <P>My own Gauntlets of Fumbling are well-worn and comfortable.&nbsp; Someday I 
  will learn that nobody else cares about my technology whims.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Gauntlets of Dexterity</FONT></P>
<P>So it's important to learn how to set aside our own preferences when 
appropriate.&nbsp; However, we don't want to also set aside the deep technology 
understanding we have.&nbsp; Those two things come together, like the two sides 
of a coin.&nbsp; The religious preferences are inseparable from the 
expertise.&nbsp; The former is an obstacle to marketing discussions, but 
the&nbsp;latter is a&nbsp;tremendous asset.&nbsp; Stretching my NetHack analogy 
a bit further, using our understanding of technology in marketing is like 
wearing Gauntlets of Dexterity.</P>
<P>Lots of strategic marketing decisions are better made by someone who really 
understands the technologies involved.&nbsp; Joel Spolsky <A 
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Stupidity.html">claims</A> that 
<EM>"no software company can succeed</EM> unless there is a programmer at the 
helm".&nbsp; I am inclined to agree, and&nbsp;I further&nbsp;argue that "what's 
good for the CEO is good for the marketing team".&nbsp; </P>
<P>I write about Marketing for Geeks because, quite frankly, marketing needs 
us.&nbsp; Lots of marketing decisions are actually technology decisions in 
disguise.&nbsp; Geeks understand what is going on under the hood.&nbsp; Our 
technology depth allows us to process decisions with greater dexterity.&nbsp; We 
can see through the <A 
href="Abstraction_Pile.html">abstractions</A>.&nbsp; 
We know the technical side effects of our choices, and we know how users are 
going to be affected.&nbsp; When marketing decisions get made without our 
expertise, big mistakes can happen.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A good example&nbsp;right now&nbsp;is&nbsp;deciding whether&nbsp;to migrate a 
desktop application from VB6 to VB.NET.&nbsp; Geeks want to be using the latest 
tools, but do users want to install the 20 meg .NET runtime?&nbsp; How will they 
get it?&nbsp; Do our customers have cable modems?&nbsp; Will something go 
wrong?</P>
<P>The Vault client is written in C# and therefore requires the .NET Framework 
on the desktop side.&nbsp; For us, this is no problem, since our customer base 
is very likely to have already installed it.&nbsp; But selling a 
desktop&nbsp;app to normal people&nbsp;would be&nbsp;an entirely different 
matter.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>As far as I can tell, many developers today are still waiting before they 
  require the .NET runtime in their apps.&nbsp; <A 
  href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/">CityDesk 2.0</A> is about to be 
  released, still written in VB6.<BR><BR>
  <LI>At Gnomedex I had the pleasure of meeting Nick Bradbury, the legendary 
  programmer behind HomeSite.&nbsp; Nick is concerned about the impact of the 
  .NET runtime on users, so he is writing <A 
  href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/beta/">FeedDemon</A> in tried-and-true 
  Delphi, and wondering if perhaps his next big product&nbsp;will be&nbsp;the 
  right time to try C#.</LI></UL>
<P>This can be a tough decision for application developers today.&nbsp; It is a 
technology choice, so it really needs to be done with the help of geeks.&nbsp; 
But it has marketing implications,&nbsp;so it's important to set aside 
our&nbsp;own preferences and keep a pure focus on the user.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Bottom Line</FONT></P>
<P>You're a geek, and before you can get competently involved in marketing you 
have to admit that you are not normal.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Your geekiness is your strength, and it makes you a good developer.&nbsp; But 
there is a time to talk about what normal people want.&nbsp; When you do 
marketing stuff,&nbsp;wear the right gloves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set aside part of your 
geekiness, just for a little while.</P>
<P>Let's close this piece with a bit of humor.&nbsp; For those of you who missed 
my talk at Gnomedex, here are a few clues to further help distinguish geeks from 
normal people.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
