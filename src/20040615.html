<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of&nbsp;Perspective says that "marketing effects take place over an 
extended period of time", but the basic point of this chapter is that some 
marketing actions are negative in the long-term even though they seem positive 
in the short-term.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Short-Term Highs</FONT></P>
<P>The authors include an interesting discussion of sales and coupons in the 
retailing industry.&nbsp; They argue that these devices are like drugs -- they 
produce a short-term high, but the only way to maintain the high is to keep 
going.&nbsp; Eventually, you have to "keep those coupons rolling out not to 
increase sales but to keep sales from falling off if you stop."&nbsp; I assume 
this is the reason that our local&nbsp;furniture store&nbsp;is <EM>always</EM> 
running a sale -- they&nbsp;are afraid of going through&nbsp;withdrawl.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>This advice can be applied in a small ISV.&nbsp; Resist the temptation to run 
short-term special sales.&nbsp; You may increase revenue in the short-run, but 
you may eventually train your customers not to buy at "regular" prices.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Patience</FONT></P>
<P>It is&nbsp;generally understood&nbsp;that public companies are forced into a 
3-month planning horizon.&nbsp; Earnings must be reported to the public every 
quarter.&nbsp; If the stockholders are not happy with those earnings, then they 
will sell the stock, and its price will go down.&nbsp; In other words, the 
public is short-sighted, so publicly-owned companies must therefore find a way 
to be short-sighted as well.</P>
<P>This is one of the things I like about running a privately-held 
company.&nbsp; We have the freedom to be patient and look a bit further down the 
road.&nbsp; We don't have to do things which are positive in the short-term and 
negative in the long-term.</P>
