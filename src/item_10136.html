<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Comparing Vault to GotDotNet Workspaces</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">06 Nov 2003</span></p>
<P>Robert McLaws <A 
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/posts/36256.aspx">asks</A> me to compare <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</A> to GotDotNet <A 
href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/docs/about.aspx">Workspaces</A>.&nbsp; 
Granted, he admits the question was a setup to give me a chance to preach my 
favorite sermon.&nbsp; Still, the pulpit awaits, so I can't resist...</P>
<P>With our recent introduction of a Single User Edition of Vault, the price 
point for a solitary user is so low that it invites comparison to free solutions 
like Workspaces.&nbsp; But substantial differences remain.&nbsp; It helps to 
remember that Vault is still basically priced at $399/user.&nbsp; At that price, 
it is one of the least expensive among the serious players in this market.&nbsp; 
We're comfortable comparing Vault to systems which cost 2 and 3 times as 
much.</P>
<P>But the popularity of Vault has exceeded even our own expectations.&nbsp; We 
keep hearing cries from people who want to use Vault but can't justify its 
price.&nbsp; And we hate to say no, so we've tried to be very creative about 
pricing.&nbsp; We want to make it possible for smaller teams to use Vault, even 
as we keep the basic price point at $399/user.&nbsp; Our original solution to 
this problem was our Starter Pack, five licenses for $599.&nbsp; But even then, 
we got a surprising number of people pining for a one-user license at a 
dirt-cheap price.</P>
<P>So earlier this week we responded by creating the Single User Edition at 
$49.&nbsp; We've been very surprised how many of these things we've sold 
already.&nbsp; The total revenue isn't going to change my life, but the number 
of units is strong evidence that people really did like this idea.</P>
<P>But like I said, $49 is close enough to zero that several new comparisons 
seem appropriate.&nbsp; Still, I&nbsp;don't tend to think of Vault and 
Workspaces as comparables.&nbsp; I should admit that I haven't used GotDotNet 
Workspaces any further than a mere demo of its features.&nbsp; But a truly 
detailed comparison may not be necessary.&nbsp; There are some pretty big 
differences that will serve as key decision factors for most people.</P>
<P>The most important advantage of Vault is rather obvious:&nbsp; Our <A 
href="http://vaultthemovie.com/">video</A> is a lot&nbsp;cooler than <A 
href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/docs/">theirs</A>.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif">
</P>
<P>Seriously, the biggest difference is that Workspaces is hosted on Microsoft's 
server farm, while Vault is software you download and install on your own 
server.&nbsp; I'm not motivated to claim that either approach is better than the 
other.&nbsp; This is a pretty clear choice.&nbsp; With all due respect to Robert 
who asked the original question, anybody who can't choose between these two 
extremes probably had a hard time deciding between Bush and Clinton in the 1992 
election.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>We obviously work hard to make Vault easy to install and maintain, but any 
effort is a lot more than no effort at all.&nbsp; Workspaces is really 
simple.&nbsp; There isn't really anything to install or maintain.&nbsp; It takes 
a few minutes to get going, and it just works.</P>
<P>But of course, the simpler administration of Workspaces comes with a 
tradeoff:&nbsp; Vault is a <STRONG>lot</STRONG> more powerful.&nbsp; I'm not 
saying this to be critical of Workspaces or the obviously talented folks who 
designed it.&nbsp; Workspaces is a system which seems to solve its intended 
problem very well.&nbsp; But it wasn't designed to be a powerful shrinkwrap SCM 
tool.&nbsp; Workspaces achieves simplicity by sacrificing flexibility.</P>
<P>Vault has everything you would expect to find in a top-notch source control 
package:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>There are no arbitrary limits to how much data you can put in.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Your data is safely tucked away in SQL Server 2000.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Vault has powerful capabilities for branching and merging parallel lines 
  of development.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Vault can import your VSS database, including all history.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Vault comes with a .NET client API so you can build your own custom 
  clients using the same API we use here at SourceGear. 
  <LI>Vault has an IDE integration client, a regular GUI client, and a 
  command-line client. 
  <LI>Vault can be accessed from Unix (currently vapor, but coming in Vault 2.0) 

  <LI>Vault leverages the underlying SQL engine to allow querying your 
  repository history in lots of cool ways.</LI></UL>
<P>I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the idea, and&nbsp;anyway, I tend 
to get dizzy if I consume too much of my own Kool-Aid.</P>
<P>We're comparing a compact car to a pickup truck.&nbsp; The car serves its 
purpose very simply and very efficiently.&nbsp; The pickup truck is a lot more 
powerful and a lot more flexibile and therefore a lot more expensive.&nbsp; Both 
have their place, and the world seems happy allowing them both to be very 
successful.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Obviously, I like Vault.&nbsp; I prefer having my code repository close to 
me, right there on the LAN where I live.&nbsp; And I place a high value on 
powerful features like 3-way merge.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, I drive a really big 
pickup truck as well.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"> </P>
