<P>On this weblog I often use the term "small ISV".&nbsp; It's time to define 
what I mean.</P>
<P>ISV stands for "Independent Software Vendor".&nbsp; The acronym seems to be 
most often used within the Microsoft ecosystem, so it carries somewhat of a 
Windows-centric connotation, but that's not really part of its definition.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>An ISV creates, markets and sells software products.&nbsp; Consulting shops 
are not ISVs, although an ISV sometimes does consulting work.&nbsp; Value-added 
resellers are not ISVs, although an ISV sometimes resells stuff from somebody 
else.&nbsp; In an ISV, you have to envision the product you want to build and 
take a risk that somebody will still want to buy it by the time you get it 
built.&nbsp; If you don't have a software product, you are not an ISV.</P>
<P>A small ISV is an ISV which is not big.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>When I think of a small ISV, I think of a privately held, self-funded 
company, but I won't&nbsp;reject you just&nbsp;because you happen to have a VC 
lurking around.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The word "small" is a relative term, so I won't define a quantitative 
limit.&nbsp; Your small ISV might have 3 employees, 25 employees or 50.&nbsp; If 
you have more than 100, you might want to start asking yourself if the word 
"small" is still appropriate, but I won't kick you out of my club just because 
your headcount has 3 digits.</P>
<P>Small ISVs tend to stay small.&nbsp; If they get big, they do it <A 
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html">very 
slowly</A>.&nbsp; They grow organically, funding their growth with their own 
revenues.&nbsp; Small ISVs are often very boring and very profitable.</P>
<P>I like writing about small ISVs because I work in <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">one</A>.&nbsp; I believe small ISVs are where 
the opportunities are today.&nbsp; I know that not everyone is going to agree 
with me on this point.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'm suggesting it may be time to reset our expectations.&nbsp; During the 
bubble, we put a&nbsp;lot of our efforts into building big companies 
fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our perspective&nbsp;changed&nbsp;radically when we saw things 
like LNUX&nbsp;with a $13&nbsp;billion valuation on its first day.&nbsp; Small 
private companies could not begin to produce that level of excitement, so we 
began to treat them with disdain.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It's 2003 now, and&nbsp;not much of the bubble survived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LNUX&amp;d=t">LNUX</A> has lost 99.7% off its 
value.&nbsp; I could name dozens of other examples with similar results.&nbsp; 
In fact, one of the few remaining leftovers from the bubble is that we still 
have widespread disdain for small companies.&nbsp; I think this&nbsp;attitude 
sometimes blinds us to the cool opportunities to be found in building a small 
ISV.</P>
