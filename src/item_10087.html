<p><span class="ArticleTitle">You just never know when someone from Microsoft might be listening...</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">07 May 2003</span></p>
<P>Singing my favorite tune once again:</P>
<P>I want a cross-platform story for managed code.&nbsp; <EM>Any</EM> 
story.&nbsp; I envy my Java brethren because although "Write Once Run 
Everywhere" is a big over-promise, it actually <EM>is</EM> possible to write a 
Java program which runs on multiple platforms.</P>
<P>Don't feel like you have to aim high.&nbsp; Feel free to make .NET's 
cross-platform support as lame as Java's client-side GUI support.</P>
<P>I like C#.&nbsp; More importantly, I just turned 35 so I am way too old to 
ever learn another programming language.&nbsp; Please make C# awesome.&nbsp; It 
is probably the last language I will ever use.</P>
