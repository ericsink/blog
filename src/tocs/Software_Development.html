<span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/entries/Read_the_Diffs.html">Read the Diffs</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Monday, 2 February 2009</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/articles/Requirements.html">Requirements</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Monday, 14 May 2007</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/articles/Code_Coverage.html">Advocating the use of code coverage</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Tuesday, 12 September 2006</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/articles/Yours_Mine_Ours.html">Yours, Mine and Ours</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Thursday, 2 February 2006</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/articles/Four_Questions.html">My life as a Code Economist</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Friday, 11 November 2005</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/articles/Crowd_Test.html">Scalability Story</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Saturday, 15 October 2005</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/articles/Choir.html">My comments on "Hitting the High Notes"</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Monday, 26 September 2005</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/entries/agile_27july2005.html">Thoughts on development methodologies</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Wednesday, 27 July 2005</span>)<blockquote></blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">Great Hacker != Great Hire</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Thursday, 5 August 2004</span>)<blockquote>When great hackers are as fussy as Graham says they are, they're not worth the trouble.&nbsp; We want the super-productivity, and we want the innate love of software development, but we don't want all the extra baggage.
</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="/item_10134.html">Single User Source Control</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Monday, 3 November 2003</span>)<blockquote>For any team of two or more people, I&nbsp;can credibly argue the benefits of 
a good source control tool.&nbsp; And as the team&nbsp;gets even 
larger,&nbsp;source control evolves from "beneficial" to "compelling" to 
"necessary" and finally to "you are a complete bozo if you don't use it".</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../F5.html">F5</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Wednesday, 3 September 2003</span>)<blockquote>And then I realized that my lousy problem-solving skills are actually Visual Studio's fault.</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Career_Calculus.html">Career Calculus</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Tuesday, 19 August 2003</span>)<blockquote>I submit that worrying about how others perceive your C value is a waste of time. The key to a great career is to focus on L, the first derivative of the equation. L is the rate at which your cluefulness is changing over time. The actual value of C at any given moment is usually a distraction. Only one question matters: With each day that goes by, are you getting more clueful, or less clueful? Or are you just stuck?</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Beyond_CheckOut_and_CheckIn.html">Beyond CheckOut and CheckIn</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Thursday, 26 June 2003</span>)<blockquote>Many people use only a small portion of the features of the version control system. If you use little more than checkout and checkin, you might actually be in the majority. A Vault user recently asked me to explain why anyone would use things like Share, Branch, Label, Cloak, and Merge Branch Into Trunk. I had fun writing my response, so I thought I would re-post it here. Beware, this writeup doesn't even attempt to be objective about which version control product is most neato. :-)</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../No_Programmers.html">Small ISVs:&nbsp; You need Developers, not Programmers</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Friday, 9 May 2003</span>)<blockquote>For the purpose of this article, a "programmer" is someone who does nothing but code new features and [if you're lucky] fix bugs. They don't write specs. &nbsp;They don't write automated test scripts. &nbsp;They don't help keep the automated build system up to date. They don't help customers work out tough problems. They don't help write documentation. They don't help with testing. They don't even <em>read</em> code. All they do is write new code. In a small ISV, you don't want <em>any</em> of these people in your company.</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Small_ISV_Defined.html">What is a Small ISV?</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Thursday, 8 May 2003</span>)<blockquote>On this weblog I often use the term "small ISV". It's time to define what I mean.</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Pile_Followups.html">Followups on The .NET Abstraction Pile</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Tuesday, 29 April 2003</span>)<blockquote>Near the bottom of my article on The .NET Abstraction Pile, I mention that we've had some bad experiences with Java here at SourceGear. Yesterday I was pleasantly surprised when Joel Spolsky linked my article (thanks Joel). Today my mailbox is filled with email from Java fans telling me my remarks were unfair and incorrect.</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Iceberg.html">Iceberg Sneak-Ins</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Monday, 28 April 2003</span>)<blockquote>Good project managers are made entirely out of paranoia, but the truly <em>extraordinary</em> project managers have a streak of courage.</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Abstraction_Pile.html">The .NET Abstraction Pile</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Tuesday, 22 April 2003</span>)<blockquote>This success stands as a testimony to how incredible .NET really is. We built a reasonably full-featured version control system in 14 months, and it works. Sure, we had some trouble. Layers 25, 37 and 40 didn't always behave like they should. But layer 11 was problem-free, quite unlike its Java counterpart. Considering the productivity gains we received, I never expected things to go so smoothly.</blockquote><span class="DayPageArticleTitle"><a href="../Are_Programmers_Engineers.html">Are Programmers Engineers?</a></span> (<span class=ArticleDate>Sunday, 30 March 2003</span>)<blockquote>Our universities call us engineers because there is no college where we fit. I don't blame them for that, but I have no desire to borrow the word engineer as an attempt to make myself sound more credible.</blockquote>
