<p>This page serves as the table of contents for my series of articles entitled "Marketing for Geeks".  The central theme here is that if we demystify marketing, it can be competently done by technical people.</p>
<p>In most <a href="/Small_ISV_Defined.html">small ISVs</a>, it's important for at least some of the developers to have an understanding of basic marketing.  However, most geeks tend to shy away from marketing, citing their lack of creativity and graphic design skills.  But these are typically not the differentiators which determine whether marketing is competent or not.  Marketing efforts tend to succeed or fail on their strategy, not on their artwork.  In fact, many teams can improve their marketing simply by realizing that marketing, like software development, has two distinct phases.</p>
<h2>The Two Phases of Marketing</h2>
<p>When we build software, we typically have a design phase, followed by an implementation phase.  In the design phase, we carefully figure out exactly what we want to do.  In the implementation phase, we do it.</p>
<p>Likewise, marketing has a strategic phase, followed by a communication phase.</p><ul> <li>The strategic phase is analogous to the design phase of building software.  (In fact, they are related and must usually be done together.)<br /><br /> </li> <li>The communication phase is analogous to the implementation phase of building software.  We call this set of activities "marketing communications", or "marcomm" for short.  </li> </ul>
<p>I find it interesting that although marketing people and technical people often think they have nothing in common, both groups naturally try to weasel out of doing their first phase.  Maverick programmers don't want to write specs and do design.  They simply want to write code.  Similarly, marketing people often prefer to plunge headfirst into creating messages, taglines and ad campaigns.  In either case, skipping the first phase will get you the instant gratification of visible results, but you'll have all kinds of trouble down the road.</p>
