<P>I will be the speaker tomorrow evening at the <A 
href="http://www.centralil.net/community/">Central Illinois .NET Users 
Group</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Title</STRONG>:&nbsp; Tradeoffs in using ASP.NET as the&nbsp;server 
for an ISV Product</P>
<P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:&nbsp; ASP.NET Web Services offer an RPC-like model 
which makes it easy to write client-server applications.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;all 
this productivity comes at a price,&nbsp;especially for shrinkwrap 
products.&nbsp; In this talk, I will discuss the tradeoffs we have discovered by 
using ASP.NET and IIS as the server for SourceGear Vault.</P>
<P><EM>Update:&nbsp; In response to several requests, later this week I will 
post my slides and/or a summary of my presentation.</EM></P>
