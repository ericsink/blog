<P>I like to periodically look at what's going on within other developer 
communities.&nbsp; I obviously spend most of my time in the .NET world, but it 
is always good to have a broader perspective.&nbsp; It's been a long time since 
I looked seriously at the Java community.&nbsp; We were very serious about Java 
once, but that was a long time ago.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>I believe strongly that a group's potential is eventually limited by the 
  strength of its leadership.&nbsp; I'm an outsider, but it still looks to me 
  like the leadership in the Java world is Fouled Up Beyond ALL 
  Recognition.&nbsp; Java ISVs don't know whether to listen to <A 
  href="http://www.sun.com/">Mom</A> or <A 
  href="http://www.ibm.com/">Dad</A>.&nbsp; Everybody knows IBM should just buy 
  Sun and clean up the mess.&nbsp; When are they going to do it?<BR><BR>
  <LI>I downloaded <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</A> 
  yesterday.&nbsp; At first I was shocked when I saw the download is 84 
  MB.&nbsp; Then I realized that's about four percent of the size of Visual 
  Studio.&nbsp; I gotta recalibrate.&nbsp; I think I'm several years behind the 
  curve in&nbsp;the way I think about the size of apps.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It's really cool that one of the leading Java IDEs is made by a <A 
  href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">small ISV</A>.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It looks like&nbsp;weblogs have some <A 
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/">real</A> <A 
  href="http://www.javablogs.com/">traction</A> in the Java world.&nbsp; 
  Neato.&nbsp; I've subscribed to a few.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It is interesting to note that there are <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/jugs/">Java user groups</A>.&nbsp; However, there 
  seems to be something missing when I compare this to <A 
  href="http://www.ineta.org/">INETA</A>.&nbsp; Passion, perhaps?<BR><BR>
  <LI>Maybe this perspective is outdated, but I still think of Java as being 
  strong on the server and lame on the desktop.&nbsp; SWT looks like the right 
  kind of answer.&nbsp; Does <A href="http://www.wx4j.org/">wx4j</A> have any 
  traction in the Java world?&nbsp; I love cross-platform development, so I've 
  always wished I had a problem for which <A 
  href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</A> could be the solution.<BR><BR>
  <LI>I remember the JClass library from KL Group.&nbsp; Oops, I see they're now 
  called Sitraka.&nbsp; Oops, I see they're now called <A 
  href="http://www.quest.com/">Quest Software</A>, apparently by way of an 
  acquisition.</LI></UL>
<P>I wish I was going to <A href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne</A> at 
the end of this month.&nbsp; There's nothing like a trade show as a way to take 
the pulse of a developer community.&nbsp; In the past, this event has drawn 
around 25,000 attendees.&nbsp; That's over twice the size of 
Tech-Ed!<BR><BR></P>

<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of&nbsp;Exclusivity says that "Two companies cannot own the same word 
in the prospect's mind."</P>
<P>It's time to face the facts.&nbsp; Some of these laws seem to have more punch 
than others.&nbsp; For example, I find the <A 
href="item_10178.html">Law of Focus</A> to be a 
concept with a lot of impact.&nbsp; It's very counter-intuitive, and yet very 
powerful.</P>
<P>Other laws here&nbsp;seem almost, well ... obvious.&nbsp; These other laws 
don't seem to deserve their pages quite as much as the great ones like the Law 
of Focus.&nbsp; I speculate that for some reason, Ries and Trout wanted exactly 
22, so they kept adding laws until they got the right number.&nbsp; Too 
bad.&nbsp; If they had stopped at 21 they could have used some sort of a 
blackjack theme.</P>
<P>The&nbsp;Law of Exclusivity&nbsp;would have been a candidate for 
removal.&nbsp; It is fairly intuitive to me that two companies cannot have the 
same market position.</P>
<P>Still, let's not dismiss this law too quickly.&nbsp; After all, obviousness 
is not always a reason to ignore a topic.&nbsp; It is obvious that we should all 
eat better and exercise more, but we don't.</P>
<P>Similarly, marketers do&nbsp;routinely find a way to&nbsp;violate this 
law.&nbsp; They do a&nbsp;Smart Thing by following the Law of Focus and choosing 
one key benefit around which they build their product message.&nbsp; Then do a 
Dumb Thing by choosing the same benefit as somebody else.&nbsp; Almost 
invariably, they end up beating their head against the wall in futility.&nbsp; 
It is obvious that we should not try to beat somebody else at their own 
game.&nbsp; And yet, we often try.</P>
<P>The chapter cites the&nbsp;war between Duracell and Energizer as an 
example.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that even though the book is ten years 
old, this war is still going on, with both companies fighting to own the word 
"long-lasting".&nbsp; I think this is because no other word matters in this 
market segment.&nbsp; What&nbsp;attribute could possibly be more important in a 
battery than "long-lasting"?&nbsp; I think these two companies are doomed to an 
eternity of shouting the same message.&nbsp; Ten years ago, it was apparently 
clear to Ries and Trout that Duracell was the owner of the word 
"long-lasting".&nbsp; I'm not sure this seems so clear to me today, but Duracell 
<A 
href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/CNBCTV/Articles/TVReports/P72274.asp">still</A> 
has the lead with 46% market share to 33% for Energizer.</P>
<P>Incidentally, the fact that this book is ten years old actually makes the 
examples more fun, in my opinion.&nbsp; For example, in the previous chapter, it 
was interesting to read the authors' perspective on Lotus and compare it to the 
ten years of hindsight we now have.</P>
