Another interesting tidbit from Tech-Ed last week:  I received a business card from somebody at Microsoft:<br /><img height="177" alt="" src="/msft_bizcard_dotnet.jpg" width="300" border="0" /><br />
I laughed and commented on the fact that the ".NET" is bigger than the word Microsoft.  Cracking a half-smile, the person said, ".NET <b>is</b> bigger than Microsoft."
I'm <b>glad</b> Microsoft is betting the company on .NET because we are placing the same bet here at SourceGear.  And I can finally talk about it.  <img height="15" alt="" src="/smiley.gif" width="15" border="0" /><br /><br />
At Tech-Ed last week we unveiled a new product which is currently under development.  It is a version control system built entirely on the .NET platform.  We call it <a href="http://vault.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear Vault</a>.<br /><br />
We are still committed to continued support for our VSS-based tools (SourceOffSite Classic and Collab), but after years of being a vendor of VSS add-ons, we are now ready to become a vendor of a VSS replacement.  Vault is a next-generation system, and we are very excited about it here.  It was gratifying that everyone who heard our story at Tech-Ed was enthusiastic as well.<br /><br />
Vault has been under development for quite some time, and it was strong enough to show live demos in the booth at Tech-Ed.  However it won't be truly ready for release until this fall.  This is the first time we have actively marketed a product so far in advance of its availability.  Rather than allow others to tease us for hyping our "vaporware", we decided to just buy a special effects fog machine and do the teasing ourselves!<br /><center><a href="vault_vapor_big.jpg"></a></center><img height="270" alt="" src="/vault_vapor.jpg" width="360" border="0" /><br />
