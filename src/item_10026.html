Service Pack 1 for .NET is out, and it introduces a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/directory/article.asp?ID=kb;en-us;Q317399">bug</a>.<br><br>
This change in the default security policy is a setback for the .NET vision.  One of the coolest things about the .NET platform is the ability to do automatic web deployment of real apps.  The functionality is similar in concept to Java applets, except without Java's poor quality GUI controls.<br><br>SP1 changes things to reduce the amount of permissions granted to .NET apps.  This seems like a mistake and a very tangible reduction in the coolness of .NET.
