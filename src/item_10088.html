<p><span class="ArticleTitle">The software industry is not dead</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">08 May 2003</span></p>
<P>I see lots of&nbsp;discussion lately about&nbsp;the possibility 
that&nbsp;software is a <A 
href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=42245&amp;ixReplies=26">dead 
industry</A>, or that perhaps the good times are <A 
href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=42453&amp;ixReplies=26">behind 
us</A>.&nbsp; I myself am fond of moaning that I was born ten years too late, 
missing out on the frontier-like climate of the software industry in the 
eighties.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>But the software industry is alive and there are plenty of good times 
ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think lots&nbsp;of cool products&nbsp;are wanting to be 
built.&nbsp; Not very many of them will get you VC funding or put you&nbsp;on 
your way to the NASDAQ.&nbsp; But this isn't a bad time to build a successful <A 
href="Small_ISV_Defined.html">small ISV</A>.</P>
<P>Need ideas?&nbsp; I just finished reading Carlos Perez' <A 
href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/ceperez/20030108">101 Reasons Why Java is 
Better than .NET</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that&nbsp;I certainly don't agree with the 
claim made in his title.&nbsp; Some of his items are FUD or just plain 
wrong.&nbsp; But some of those items are accurate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We .NET fans have to admit that Java has been around longer and therefore has 
things that are not&nbsp;yet available in the .NET ecosystem.&nbsp; You can view 
those things as disadvantages of .NET or you can view them as product 
opportunities.&nbsp; Carlos' list could have been titled <EM>101 Product Ideas 
for a .NET Small ISV</EM>.&nbsp; I'm not saying that all those ideas are 
<EM>good</EM> ones, but something on the list might get the idea flow 
started.</P>
