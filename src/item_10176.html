<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #3:  The Law of the Mind</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">03 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of the Mind says it is better to be first in the mind than first in 
the marketplace.</P>
<P>To be honest, this is not my favorite chapter of the book.&nbsp; The concept 
of "mindshare" is important, but I don't think Ries and Trout make the point 
very clearly.</P>
<P>And as long as I'm giving unsolicited advice to marketing legends, let's 
remove the word "immutable" from the title of this book, okay?&nbsp; How can 
laws be <A 
href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=immutable">immutable</A> when 
there are so many exceptions?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Law #1 says that it is better to be first than it is to be better.&nbsp; Law 
#3 says that it is better to be first only if doing so is the way to gaining 
significant mindshare.</P>
<P>Not too far in the future, <A href="http://www.tivo.com/">Tivo</A> will be 
the perfect example of an exception to both of these laws.&nbsp; They were first 
in the market.&nbsp; Furthermore, they have enormous mindshare.&nbsp; The Tivo 
name is like Kleenex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though&nbsp;my digital video 
recorder&nbsp;is not really a&nbsp;Tivo, I still call it one.&nbsp; With that 
kind of mindshare, and having been first in the market, laws 1 and 3 say that 
Tivo should&nbsp;be dominant and should stay that way for a long time.</P>
<P>But Tivo will lose.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;important to understand these marketing 
laws, but they are not immutable.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Problems in Measuring 
Mindshare</FONT></P>
<P>Our industry seems to spend a lot of its time either underestimating or 
overestimating the power and value of mindshare:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>We underestimate the value of mindshare when we try to change the minds of 
  people.&nbsp; Ries and Trout say that "The single most wasteful thing you can 
  do in marketing is to change a mind."&nbsp; I would love to know how much it 
  will eventually cost to convince the world's VB6 programmers to move to 
  VB.NET.&nbsp; The audacity of this move is simply amazing.&nbsp; For any other 
  company in the history of the earth, it would be suicide to try and change the 
  minds of several million of your own customers.<BR><BR>
  <LI>We tend to overestimate the value of mindshare as well.&nbsp; During 
  the&nbsp;dotcom bubble,&nbsp;venture capitalists&nbsp;sacrificed several 
  billion dollars on the&nbsp;altar of Law #3.&nbsp; Mindshare was sought and 
  purchased at unbelievable premiums.&nbsp; In hindsight, it seems 
  apparent&nbsp;that mindshare which was quickly gained can be quickly 
lost.</LI></UL>
<P>The problem here is that we talk about customer minds without reminding 
ourselves that not all of those minds think the same way.&nbsp; Remember the <A 
href="/Act_Your_Age.html">marketing bell 
curve</A>?&nbsp; Changing the mind of an early adopter is cheap and easy.&nbsp; 
Changing the mind of a conservative or a laggard is expensive and hard.&nbsp; 
These differences cause us to either overestimate or underestimate the value of 
mindshare:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>If most of your mindshare inventory is in early adopters, you are in 
  trouble.&nbsp; Early adopters don't stay anywhere very long.&nbsp; Eventually, 
  you <STRONG>will</STRONG> lose most of them.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Your&nbsp;valuable mindshare is among conservatives.&nbsp; It will be very 
  expensive for anyone who wants to take these people away from you.<BR><BR>
  <LI>If you are a new player trying to gain mindshare, don't be afraid to steal 
  early adopters from your competitor.&nbsp; It's easier than you think.&nbsp; 
  Just remember that the next guy is going to steal them from you.</LI></UL>
<P>This is why Tivo will lose.&nbsp; They built enormous mindshare among the 
early adopters, but never really made it into the mainstream markets of the 
pragmatists and conservatives.&nbsp; In the end, Tivo will end up in the same 
place as the dotcoms, at the bottom of the <A
