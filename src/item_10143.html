<P>Due largely to a <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/27/0516211&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187">link</A> 
from Slashdot (thanks!), "<A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software12292003.asp">Make 
More Mistakes</A>" has endured the scrutiny of more readers than most of my 
other essays.&nbsp; I've been getting a great deal of feedback, which I do 
appreciate.</P>
<P>Lots of people have asked me how SourceGear has been able to financially 
survive all those awful mistakes I've made.&nbsp; Some have checked my 
background and speculated that I funded all those mistakes using money I got 
from the Spyglass IPO, and therefore a posture of risk-taking is appropriate 
only for those who are already rich, and therefore my article doesn't really 
apply.&nbsp; That's essentially incorrect, but there is a grain of truth 
here.&nbsp; I made some nice money when Spyglass went public (but nowhere near 
enough to retire).&nbsp; The presence of financial cushion sometimes has made it 
easier to take a risk, even though I am already a risk-taker by nature.</P>
<P>But in actuality, very little money has ever flowed from me to 
SourceGear.&nbsp; With the exception of a small amount of capital we received 
from a few angel investors, SourceGear has been entirely funded from its own 
revenues.&nbsp; If this doesn't seem to add up, then keep in mind that half the 
story of SourceGear is not being told right now.</P>
<P>The "mistakes" article tells the story of my failures, but&nbsp;we've 
experienced an approximately equal collection of successes.&nbsp; I'm 
not&nbsp;going to tell those stories right now.&nbsp; It should be sufficient to 
know that our losses happened in the context of some wins, some of them quite 
large.&nbsp; Each time I took a risk, I tried to be sure that the size of the 
risk was appropriate for the company's resources at that time.</P>
<P>If you are just starting out, or if your company is much smaller than 
SourceGear, then my mistakes may seem enormous to you.&nbsp; Absent my bad bets, 
I could be driving a Ferrari right now.&nbsp; Still, none of&nbsp;these mistakes 
were fatal for SourceGear.</P>
<P>Regardless of the scale of your business, the central point of my article 
still applies:&nbsp; "Make all the non-fatal mistakes that you can -- don't make 
any of the fatal ones."&nbsp;&nbsp;Only you can figure out what&nbsp;might 
be&nbsp;"fatal" for your particular situation.&nbsp; Smaller firms should take 
smaller risks.&nbsp; Bigger firms can take much&nbsp;bigger risks without 
placing the survival of the company in jeopardy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Either way, choosing to take no risks at all is an excellent algorithm for 
avoiding success.</P>
