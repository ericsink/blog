<P>The world of mobile wireless Internet is certainly better with the new 2.5G 
networks.&nbsp; I'm using Sprint PCS Vision on my Treo.&nbsp; Web browsing and 
email access are encroaching on the realm of the usable.&nbsp; More 
specifically, this combination of device and network would definitely be usable 
for email if my mailbox were not constantly full of spam.</P>
<P>Ancient history:&nbsp; Eleven years ago I was a programmer working for a guy 
named Kurt Buehler who worked for a guy named Bill Goran.&nbsp; I wrote Motif 
widgets for a GIS system called <A

<A href="http://www.news-gazette.com/story.cfm?Number=13488">award </A>for their 
efforts in this field.&nbsp; Congratulations!</P>
