<p><img src="/images/eric_corn.jpg" align="right">In my day job I am a software developer at <a href="https://services.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2002, SourceGear was named one of the fastest growing companies in the nation by Inc magazine. </p>
<p>I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois </a> at Urbana-Champaign. Go Illini!</p>
<p>I founded the <a href="https://www.abisource.com/">AbiWord</a> project and was responsible for much of the original design and implementation.&nbsp; The title on my business card says "Software Craftsman". </p>
<p>Prior to founding SourceGear, I was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass,_Inc.">Spyglass</a> for around five years. I served there as Project Lead for the browser team. We <a href="/Browser_Wars.html">built</a> the original versions of the browser you now know as "Internet Explorer".</p>
