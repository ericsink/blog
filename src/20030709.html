<P><A href="http://developer.sys-con.com/viewitem.cfm?thread=7728">Sun guy</A>: 
"Eclipse is the wrong direction."</P>
<P>It amazes me to watch Sun and IBM bickering over Java.&nbsp; As long as they 
continue this silliness, .NET's&nbsp;eventual dominance&nbsp;is a foregone 
conclusion.&nbsp; Not that I would mind that particular outcome...&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">
</P>
<P>We've all seen company founders get forced out as their company grows.&nbsp; 
The founder applied his vision, flexibility and passion to build a company from 
nothing.&nbsp; But the company has now outgrown his skillset.&nbsp; The VCs come 
in with a capital infusion and they ask the founder to step aside and let the 
new management take the company to the next level.&nbsp; The founder reluctantly 
agrees, realizing that he can take his company no further.</P>
<P>Java is the startup company, Sun is the founder, and IBM is the new 
management.&nbsp; If Sun cares about what happens to Java, they should resign 
and let IBM take it forward.</P>
<P>I'd still be&nbsp;skeptical about whether IBM/Java could effectively compete 
with Microsoft/.NET in the long haul, but until the Java camp chooses to stop 
fighting amongst themselves, their cause is utterly hopeless.</P>
