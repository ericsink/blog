title: Source Control for One, Part Two
---

<P>There is one thing I forgot to mention in my blurb last night about source 
control for single developers.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif><STRONG>Background:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>There are two basic models for how&nbsp;a developer&nbsp;interacts 
with&nbsp;a source control&nbsp;repository:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><STRONG>"checkout-edit-checkin"</STRONG>:&nbsp; A working copy of the 
  repository files is maintained on the client machine, and the files are marked 
  as "read-only" when they are retrieved.&nbsp; The developer uses the Check Out 
  operation to get a copy of the file which she intends to edit, and that file 
  is then changed to be writable.&nbsp; When the edits are complete, the file is 
  checked in and the working file is once again marked read-only.&nbsp; VSS 
  works this way.</P>
  <P><STRONG>"edit-merge-commit"</STRONG>:&nbsp; Once again, the client machine 
  has a working copy of the repository files, but those working files are left 
  in a writable state.&nbsp; When the developer is ready to edit a file, she 
  doesn't need to do anything to let the source control tool know about 
  it.&nbsp; Just edit the file as if source control were not involved.&nbsp; 
  When it's time to checkin those changes, the tool will notice which files have 
  changed and be ready to commit those changes to the repository.&nbsp; It may 
  be necessary to perform a merge if somebody else has modified the file in the 
  meantime.&nbsp; CVS works this way.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif><STRONG>Shameless plug for&nbsp;my 
product:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>SourceGear Vault supports either of these models, depending on the option 
settings.&nbsp; By default, Vault uses the "checkout-edit-checkin" model, for 
consistency with VSS.&nbsp; But it's easy to switch into what we call "CVS 
mode".</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif><STRONG>The thing I forgot to 
say:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>The cool thing to notice is that when using source control all by yourself, 
the "edit-merge-commit" style degenerates to simply "edit-commit".&nbsp; If 
you're thinking source control for a single developer is just too much of a pain 
to be worth the trouble, you might try&nbsp;using a tool that 
supports&nbsp;"edit-merge-commit".&nbsp; Source control can be very unintrusive 
when working that way.</P>
