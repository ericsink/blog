<p><span class="ArticleTitle">HTML Design Guru Bake-Off</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">14 May 2004</span></p>
<P>A couple of days ago, I put out a call for HTML freelancers. The good news is 
that we received a lot of responses. The bad news is that we received a LOT of 
responses.<img src="/smiley.gif"> We are overwhelmed and are unable to choose between so many 
capable designers. 
<P>We have therefore decided to proceed with a contest. Background and details 
follow below. 
<P>SourceGear is working on a web-based bug-tracking product called 
Dragnet.&nbsp;This product&nbsp;is basically a port of our existing bug-tracking 
product to ASP.NET.&nbsp;Dragnet will be released in the late [Illinois] summer 
timeframe and will support full integration with SourceGear Vault and 
SourceOffSite.&nbsp; Demos of&nbsp;Dragnet will be shown in&nbsp;the 
SourceGear&nbsp;booth at Tech-Ed in San Diego. 
<P>The zip file attached below to this posting contains several HTML pages, plus 
their supporting images and a CSS style sheet. In a nutshell, the challenge is 
to take these pages and make them look great. 
<P>One of the submitted entries will be selected as the winner and will be 
integrated into Dragnet. (Practically speaking, we will "diff" your submitted 
files against the contents of the original zip file and apply those changes to 
the ASP.NET scripts.) 
<P>Contest rules: 
<OL>
  <LI>To enter the contest, send us a zip file containing your modified version 
  of these pages. Put your name somewhere in the name of the zip file you send 
  us. You may be able to get the job done simply by replacing the style sheet, 
  but you can modify the HTML itself or the images if you want. <BR><BR>
  <LI>You can submit multiple entries if you want. Please place each entry in a 
  separate zip file. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Entries must be emailed to contest@sourcegear.com by midnight Chicago time 
  on 28 May 2004. The winner will be announced on or before 18 June. <BR><BR>
  <LI>All entrants will be mentioned, thanked and linked on my weblog. Make sure 
  you include a URL along with your entry so I know where to link you. <BR><BR>
  <LI>The winner will receive: 
  <UL>
    <LI>USD $5,000 
    <LI>glowing praise here on my weblog&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"> 
    <LI>mention in the&nbsp;Dragnet product documentation <BR><BR></LI></UL>
  <LI>Selection of the winner is entirely at the discretion of the SourceGear 
  staff. Entries may be judged on visual appearance, cleanliness of the 
  underlying HTML/CSS, standards compliance, compatibility with IE and Mozilla, 
  bandwidth usage required, and ease of integration into Dragnet. <BR><BR>
  <LI>The winner will be required to submit a mailing address so that we can 
  send a check with the prize money. If you are in the United States and are 
  entering as an individual, we will need your social security number so we can 
  report your winnings to the IRS as income (sorry). <BR><BR>
  <LI>We reserve the right to cancel the contest if we do not receive at least 
  10 entries. <BR><BR>
  <LI>All submitted entries become the property of SourceGear LLC. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Employees of SourceGear LLC and their immediate family members are not 
  eligible for this contest. <BR></LI></OL>
<P>If you plan to submit an entry, please drop me an email.&nbsp; We'd like to 
start getting a sense for how many entries there will be. 
<P>Good luck! 
<P><EM>Please note:&nbsp; This product was previously being referred to by its 
internal code-name, which was "Mantis".&nbsp; Now that the actual product name 
is decided, that name won't be used anymore, except for residual traces left in 
the zip file containing the contest materials.&nbsp; Our apologies for any 
confusion caused with respect to the open source bug-tracking tool by that 
name.</EM></P>
