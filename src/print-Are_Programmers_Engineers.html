<h2>Are Programmers Engineers?</h2>
<font size=2>30 Mar 2003</font><p>

<P>In yet another attempt to drive their ad impressions, Slashdot <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/30/1914239.shtml?tid=156">asks </A>an 
old but still controversial question:&nbsp; Are Programmers Engineers?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Certainly not.</P>
<P>I used to think otherwise.&nbsp; I graduated from the University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign where the Computer Science department is part of the College 
of Engineering.&nbsp; For a couple of years I took the same classes as the 
engineers.&nbsp; I still have the T-square to prove it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Because CS gets lumped in with engineering at many schools,&nbsp;graduating 
programmers often think of themselves as engineers.&nbsp; But the distinctions 
start appearing very quickly.</P>
<P><STRONG>Engineers are required.&nbsp; Programmers are optional.&nbsp; 
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>To be an engineer, you have to be licensed.&nbsp; You have to pass the 
  Professional Engineer exam.&nbsp; Engineering is one of those fields where you 
  have to have a license to know the right answer.&nbsp; Law is like this 
  too.&nbsp; I'm quite certain I know more about copyright law than most small 
  town attorneys.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they are allowed to render their opinion 
  on the subject whereas I am not.&nbsp; Engineering is similar.&nbsp; Some 
  things can only be legally done by a licensed engineer.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>Anybody is allowed to write code.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Engineers work for a living.&nbsp; Programmers do what they love to 
do.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Engineers are generally marked by a higher degree of professionalism than 
  programmers.&nbsp; Some people think this is because of the certification, but 
  I think it comes simply from the origins of career choice.&nbsp; Many 
  programmers started coding as a hobby and gradually made it their 
  profession.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; I was writing code years before I could drive a 
  car.&nbsp; Sometimes we make stupid choices because the distinction between 
  hobby and profession gets blurry.</P>
  <P>Engineers generally don't do that.&nbsp; Teenagers don't design bridges in 
  their spare time and then decide to pursue civil engineering as a 
  career.&nbsp; Engineers always think of their job as their profession, because 
  that's all it has ever been.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Engineering is well-understood.&nbsp; Programmers have no idea what 
they're doing.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>In general, engineers can predict their workflow.&nbsp; They don't get into 
  very many arguments about widely divergent ways of managing a project.&nbsp; 
  Ask them to estimate a project and they'll probably get it darn close.&nbsp; 
  </P>
  <P>So far, there are no universally accepted methods for management of 
  software projects.&nbsp; We all do it differently.&nbsp; Some of us get 
  amazing results with virtually no process at all.&nbsp; Some of us have formal 
  methodologies and still can't finish anything on time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Engineering is real.&nbsp; Programming is abstract.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Engineers work with physical things like electricity, mechanics and 
  heat.&nbsp; When engineers design and build something, it is usually a 
  tangible item which must be manufactured.&nbsp; You can touch it, maybe even 
  hold it in your hand.&nbsp; In some cases it will&nbsp;retain its&nbsp;value 
  for centuries.</P>
  <P>Programming is the manipulation of complex abstractions.&nbsp; We invent 
  abstractions and give them names.&nbsp; We manipulate them and use them to 
  build things.&nbsp; When our finally product is built, it requires no 
  manufacturing.&nbsp; It is merely a string of bytes.&nbsp; Theoretically, a 
  monkey sitting at the keyboard might accidentally of typed the same 
  string.&nbsp; The product we build cannot be touched or held.&nbsp; It will be 
  worthless in just a few years.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Am I saying that engineers are more valuable than programmers?&nbsp; 
Certainly not.&nbsp; Could I design a bridge, a TV, or a concrete canoe?&nbsp; 
Nope, but I defy any engineer to design and ship a good version control 
system.&nbsp; Programmers solve really hard problems too.</P>
<P>Our universities call us engineers because there is no college where we 
fit.&nbsp; I don't blame them for that, but I have no desire to borrow the word 
engineer as an attempt to make&nbsp;myself sound more credible.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Why not just admit that software development is unique?&nbsp; No other field 
is like ours.&nbsp; Engineering looks really dull to me.&nbsp; I love being a 
programmer.</P>
