<p>In the end, despite the <a href="/entries/teched_07jun2005.html">problems</a> we had, our trip to Tech-Ed was a success.</p>
<p>The Vault booth was adjacent to the booth for <a href="http://www.notionsolutions.com/">Notion Solutions</a>.&nbsp; They offer training for Team System.&nbsp; We had a good time talking with <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cmenegay">Chris Menegay</a> and the other guys there.&nbsp; I did lots of eavesdropping as they pitched their services.&nbsp; I found myself thinking that I should take their training course.&nbsp; I could probably learn something.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, Doug Newman did a demo of Allerton during his session on Team System.&nbsp; The demo went very well.&nbsp; No problems.&nbsp; Corey says the crowd actually broke into applause.&nbsp; There appeared to be around 300 people in attendance.</p>
<p>Orlando did very little to compete for the status of "Eric's Favorite City for a Conference".&nbsp; It was almost unbelievably hot and humid.&nbsp; The convention center was nice, but a lot of the hotels were quite far away.&nbsp; In my opinion, San Diego and New Orleans are neck-and-neck in the lead for this race, with everybody else a long way out of the running.</p>
<p>However, in defense of Orlando, I will admit that I have never been to a seafood place as good as <a href="http://www.fishfusion.com/">MoonFish Restaurant</a>.&nbsp; The food was simply fantastic.&nbsp; For future reference, I'll have to remember this guideline for identifying a truly amazing seafood restaurant:&nbsp; The menu lists the name of the person who caught each fish.</p>
<p>The trip home was mostly uneventful, just as it should be.&nbsp; :-)</p>
