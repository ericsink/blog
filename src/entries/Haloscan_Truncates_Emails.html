those emails, presumably to save bandwidth.&nbsp; No problem, but sometimes the
point of truncation lands in a rather unfortunate spot.</p>

<p>Lots of people have been commenting on last week's post
about women in our comic.&nbsp; This morning I posted a comment of my own,
responding to someone who asked if I was being serious or just fishing for
publicity.&nbsp; I said:</p>

question. Although I am comfortable with the comic, I've heard some complaints
from women I respect, so I thought I would solicit a broader set of
perspectives."</p>
