<p>Just ignore this blog entry.&nbsp; I had a good morning on the golf course and I want to remember every detail.&nbsp; This has <em>nothing</em> to do with software.</p>
<hr />
<p>The University of Illinois has two golf courses, the Blue and the Orange.&nbsp; I consider the Orange course to be absurdly difficult.&nbsp; Most of the greens are elevated and all of them are curvier than a cheerleader.&nbsp; There's sand, water and trees all over the place.&nbsp; To make matters worse, I'm a terrible golfer.</p>
<p>Every time I play the front nine on the Orange course, my goal is to shoot a 54 (double-bogey golf).&nbsp; In dozens of attempts, I have never succeeded.&nbsp; I routinely shoot around 57 or so.&nbsp; But today, I shot a 53, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hole #1, par 5, 542 yards.&nbsp; 3-wood into the first cut of rough on the right.&nbsp; Decent.
</li>
<li>Good 3-iron, mostly straight ahead, in the fairway.
</li>
<li>Terrible 3-iron, off to the right into the trees.&nbsp; My companions start diagnosing my swing problems.
</li>
<li>Fabulous shot.&nbsp; I chopped a 3-iron under a tree branch and over a sand trap.&nbsp; It rolled onto the green and stayed on the fringe.&nbsp; The guys on the PGA couldn't have done this shot any better, although none of them would have been in this stupid situation in the first place.
</li>
<li>Putt onto the green.&nbsp; (What psychopath chose today's pin placement on the slope in the back?)
</li>
<li>Putt
</li>
<li>Short putt for double bogey.&nbsp; That's a fine score for me on this hole.
</li>
<li>Hole #2, par 3, 163 yards over water.&nbsp; Terrible tee shot.&nbsp; I somehow got my 5-wood way under the ball and popped it up high and short.&nbsp; Another 10 feet and I would have made it all the way to the women's tee box.
</li>
<li>Duffed my 7-iron into the water.
</li>
<li>Penalty stroke
</li>
<li>Pitching wedge to the fringe
</li>
<li>Putt onto the green
</li>
<li>Putt
</li>
<li>Short putt for a quadruple bogey 7.&nbsp; At this point I am preparing myself for a bad day.
</li>
<li>Hole #3, par 4, 376 yards, dogleg around a grove of trees.&nbsp; Tee shot with 3-wood was okay.&nbsp; Anything that doesn't slice into the trees is a good shot.
</li>
<li>Good 3-iron, mostly straight ahead, over the fairway traps, short of the green.
</li>
<li>Pitch onto the green, just glad to miss the sand.
</li>
<li>Putt.&nbsp; Why are these greens so fast when it rained last night?
</li>
<li>Putt
</li>
<li>Putt for a double bogey.
</li>
<li>Hole #4, par 5, 561 yards dogleg around a lake which always seems to attract my ball like a magnet.&nbsp; 3-wood to the first cut of rough on the right.
</li>
<li>Good 3-iron, still in the rough, but not in the lake.
</li>
<li>Horrible shot.&nbsp; The lake should not even have been a factor, but I completely duff my 3-iron.&nbsp; It goes straight toward the lake and luckily hits a tree, staying dry.
</li>
<li>Chop out into the fairway.
</li>
<li>Another bad shot with the 3-iron.&nbsp; Slice off to the right, hits another tree, and bounces luckily back into the fairway.
</li>
<li>Pitching wedge just misses the green.
</li>
<li>Miracle shot with a pitching wedge goes into the cup.&nbsp; I deserved a 10 on this hole, so I take my double-bogey 7 with a sheepish grin and move on.
</li>
<li>Hole #5, par 4, 417 yards.&nbsp; Mediocre tee shot with my 3-wood, short and in the first cut on the left.&nbsp; I don't think I've hit a fairway all morning.
</li>
<li>Lay up with a 7-iron, just short of the creek.
</li>
<li>5-iron toward the green, missed right.
</li>
<li>Pitch onto the green, too far, left myself a long downhill putt back.
</li>
<li>Made the putt for a bogey 5.&nbsp; The momentum has turned in my direction.
</li>
<li>Hole #6, par 3, 154 yards.&nbsp; Used a half swing with my 3-wood, just missed the green left.
</li>
<li>Pitch onto the green.
</li>
<li>Putt
</li>
<li>Putt for a bogey 4.
</li>
<li>Hole #7, par 4, 365 yards.&nbsp; 3-wood popped up high, kind of short, in the first cut of rough on the right.
</li>
<li>Awesome 3-iron, 20 yards in front of the green.
</li>
<li>The pin is in the back today, so I play bump and run with a 5-iron, up the steep green.&nbsp; My ball rolls just off the green into the fringe.
</li>
<li>Putt onto the green.
</li>
<li>Putt for bogey 5.
</li>
<li>Hole #8, par 4, 347 yards.&nbsp; Another high tee shot with the 3-wood.&nbsp; What's wrong with me today?&nbsp; At least I'm in the fairway.
</li>
<li>Lay up with a 7-iron, just short of the water.
</li>
<li>Lame shot with the pitching wedge, through the green to the fringe.
</li>
<li>Putt onto the green.
</li>
<li>Putt
</li>
<li>Putt for a double bogey 6.
</li>
<li>Hole #9, par 4, 418 yards.&nbsp; Decent 3-wood, first cut of rough on the right.
</li>
<li>Weird hit with the 3-iron, but enough length, left side of the fairway.
</li>
<li>Bump and run with the 5-iron again, pin high on the green.
</li>
<li>Putt
</li>
<li>I should have made this easy 4-footer, but I read too much break.
</li>
<li>Putt for a double bogey 6.
</li>
</ol>
<p>So there it is.&nbsp; A lot of mediocre shots and a few <em>very</em> lucky ones.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
