title: Git is the C of Version Control Tools

<p>I've been working lately on a major revision of <a
href="/scm/source_control.html">Source Control HOWTO</a>.&nbsp;
The plan is to publish an expanded version of this material as a book later
this year.</p>

<p>The original series of chapters was written almost five
years ago, and the content is looking rather dated here in 2009.&nbsp; One of the
biggest problems is that no book on this topic can be truly credible these days
without covering distributed version control tools like Git and Mercurial.&nbsp;
These tools aren't mainstream yet, but their popularity is growing very fast.</p>

<p>So as I overhaul the content for book publication, I am
including lots of new stuff on distributed version control and how it's
different.</p>

<p>And that means I am spending a fair amount of time using
Bazaar and Git and Darcs and their ilk.&nbsp; Broadly speaking, I think these tools
are fascinating.</p>

<p>But I keep stumbling across little things that surprise me.</p>

<h3>git add -p</h3>

<p>Some folks <a
href="http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git">say</a> that Git's <a
href="http://codemac.net/blog/18/">killer feature</a> is its index.&nbsp; That's
like saying that C's killer feature is the ability to cast an int to a pointer.</p>

<p>Git's index is neato, but it allows you to do things that may
be unsafe.&nbsp; At first I didn't get this.&nbsp; Whenever I was reading about the
index, I thought it was equivalent to a pending changeset, a simple list of
changes in the working copy that are waiting to be committed to the repo.</p>

<p>But Git's index isn't just metadata.&nbsp; It doesn't just point
to things in the working copy.&nbsp; It actually contains its own copies of things.</p>

<p>And this is where Git's index is both cool and not cool.&nbsp;
One of the best practices I suggest in Source Control HOWTO is to never use a
version control feature which encourages you to checkin code which you have
never been allowed to compile and test.&nbsp; This is exactly what Git's index
allows the developer to do.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >By using "git add --p", you can choose which patches from a
     file you want to include for checkin.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >The result is that the index contains a version of the
     file which is not in your working copy.</li>
 <li >If you fire up your build tool, it will compile the
     version of the file that is sitting in your working copy, not the one
     tucked away in Git's index.</li>
 <li >If you run your unit tests, they are not testing the
     contents of the file that are about to be committed.</li>
 <li >So when you type "git commit", your repository will
     contain something that has never been compiled or tested.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >This is not a Best Practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn't mean Git or its index are bad.&nbsp; I'll agree that
"git add --p" is a very powerful feature that has its place.&nbsp; But in this
respect, Git is a bit like C.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >C is fast, hard-to-learn and it allows the developer to do
     things that are probably a bad idea.</li>
 <li >Git could be described in exactly the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not that there's anything wrong with that.&nbsp; <b>:-)&nbsp; </b>I
could actually see myself using "git add --p", but that doesn't mean it would be
a smart thing to do.</p>

<p>And I would adopt the same mindset I use when I'm coding in
C.&nbsp; Whether you're using C or Git or a 12-gauge shotgun, you need to act
differently than you do when you're in an environment that attempts to protect
you from your own mistakes.</p>
