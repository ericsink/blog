<p>NotALegend.com is a parody of an advertising campaign Microsoft did during early 2003.&nbsp; The original site was at <a href="http://www.software.legends.com">www.software.legends.com</a>, but now it's gone.</p>
<p>The WaybackMachine at archive.org has&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.softwarelegends.com/">copies</a> of the Software Legends site, but unfortunately a lot of the images are missing.</p>
<p>I'd love to get a complete copy of the original site.&nbsp; If you have one, please let me know.&nbsp; My parody just isn't quite as funny now that you can't see the object of the joke.&nbsp; :-)</p>
