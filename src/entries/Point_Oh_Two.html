<p>I'm just writing to let everybody know that the following
bugfix releases are available:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads.html">Vault
     4.0.2</a><br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li ><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/fortress/downloads.html">Fortress
     1.0.2</a><br>

</ul>

<p>This new DiffMerge build includes some (but not all) of the
improvements suggested in the comments on my <a
href="/entries/DiffMerge.html">original post</a>.&nbsp; Thanks
again for the excellent feedback we received there.&nbsp; We're still working to
address more of the requests.</p>
