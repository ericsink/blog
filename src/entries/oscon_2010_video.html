align=right hspace=12>For those who are interested, we've posted the video of
my presentation at OSCON on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SourceGear">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>I had a few problems when displaying my slide deck at the
conference.&nbsp; When I'm speaking at an event, I usually like to use whatever
equipment is provided.&nbsp; To be assured of compatibility between my MacBook Pro
and the projector, I would need to bring like [what seems like] 23 different
video adapters.&nbsp; It's easier to just bring my slide deck on a thumb drive.</p>

<p>The email from the conference organizers told us there would
be "Dell laptops" in the room.&nbsp; I remember thinking how boneheaded it was of
them to be running Windows at the Open Source convention, but I complied and
brought my slides as a PowerPoint file.</p>

<p>And then I got there and discovered that I was the one being
a bonehead for assuming that "Dell laptop" == "Windows + Office".&nbsp; Actually, those
Dell laptops were running Linux with OpenOffice.org.&nbsp; Anyway, OO.org imported
my .pptx file, but it botched the formatting in some rather unexpected and
entertaining ways.</p>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>

<p>Since OSCON ended three weeks ago, folks on our team have
been taking their summer vacations, but we've still made some good progress:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >After hearing lots of (well deserved) complaints from
     people trying to build 64-bit Veracity, we expanded our continuous
     integration build farm to do both 32 and 64 bit builds, debug and release,
     on all our platforms.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >We had just missed our goal of dogfooding Veracity's
     bug-tracking features before OSCON, but after another round of
     improvements to the Web UI stuff, now we're using Veracity not just for
     source control, but also for project tracking.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >We implemented Mercurial-style version numbers.&nbsp; They're
     specific to one instance of a repo, but still kind of handy.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >We started work on letting Veracity run through mainstream
     web servers (instead of only using its embedded web server).<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >We did lots of bug fixes, including some deep polishing
     and testing work on patterns for include/exclude settings.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I've been working in a private branch, focused mostly on
     improving performance:<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li >Every changeset record has a blob list which is used for
      making things like push/pull and incremental indexing efficient.&nbsp; For
      changesets which are a DAG merge (more than one parent), we need to
      normalize that blob list to ensure that the exact same list is
      constructed on each side of the merge.&nbsp; Our previous normalization code
      was additive.&nbsp; It walked the DAG back to the lowest common ancestor and
      added any blob which wasn't present on both sides.&nbsp; Gradually, this
      caused those blob lists to keep getting bigger and bigger, which turned
      out to be a nasty performance probem that gets worse as the repo grows.&nbsp;
      So, I switched the normalization code to remove any blob which was
      present in the blob list of any ancestor.&nbsp; This is a lot harder to
      calculate, but it results in a much tighter list.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >The changeset record for a database DAG includes a
      delta.&nbsp; When that changeset is a merge, the delta is calculated against
      the lowest common ancestor of the two parents.&nbsp; However, when it comes
      time to store that delta for later use by the indexing code, it would be
      better to calculate an equivalent delta against one of the two parents.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >In a Veracity database, every record has two fields:&nbsp;
      recid and rectype.&nbsp; However, some our databases just don't need both of
      these fields.&nbsp; For example, recid is really only useful if you plan to
      modify records, but the audit DBs are filled with record that never get
      modified.&nbsp; Similarly, if a DB only has one record type, we don't need
      every single record to have a field reminding us what the name of that
      type is.&nbsp; So, I made a bunch of changes to allow a Veracity DB to exclude
      one or both of these fields.&nbsp; Eliminating the need to store, retrieve,
      index and obey these superfluous fields resulted in a nice perf increase.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >I went through and made dozens of little optimizations in
      the indexer.&nbsp; Remember to always use SQLite's prepared statements in
      loops.&nbsp; Make sure every blob getting indexed only gets loaded once.&nbsp; Tune
      the hash table which represents JSON objects.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >I found and fixed a few GC rooting bugs in our SpiderMonkey
      code.&nbsp; BTW, I can't wait until we can upgrade to <a
      href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2010/08/02/mozillas-new-javascript-value-representation/">new
      and improved version</a> of the JS engine.&nbsp; I greatly dislike the fact
      that SpiderMonkey doesn't have a wider int.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >Unfortunately, some of my changes break compatibility, so
      I've been writing a script to migrate all our data.&nbsp; This week I'll merge
      with the trunk and we'll do what we call a "repository reboot".<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >This firehose of detail is mostly just the ramblings of
      yet another blogger who is under the delusion that anybody cares about
      the mundane elements of his day.&nbsp; Which reminds me, Thursday morning for
      breakfast I had iced coffee with an omelet made of red peppers,
      Portobello mushrooms, and provolone.&nbsp; Anyway, on the off chance that
      anything here wants to get discussed, meet me on the <a
      href="http://www.sourcegear.com/veracity/mailinglist.html">Veracity
      mailing list</a>.<br>
