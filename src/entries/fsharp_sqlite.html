title: An F# newbie using SQLite

---

<p>Like I said in a tweet on Friday, I'm guessing everybody's first 10,000
lines of F# are crap.  That's a lot of bad code I need to write, so I figure
maybe I better get started.</p>

<p>This blog entry is a journal of my first attempts at using F# to do some
SQLite stuff.  I'm using <a
href="https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw">SQLitePCL.raw</a>, which is a Portable Class Library wrapper (written in C#) allowing .NET developers to call the native SQLite library.
</p>

<p>My program has five "stanzas":</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>ONE: Open a SQLite database and create a table with two integer columns called a and b.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>TWO: Insert 16 rows with a going from 1 through 16.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>THREE: Set column b equal to a squared, and lookup the value of b for a=7.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>FOUR: Loop over all the rows where b&lt;120 and sum the a values.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>FIVE: Close the database and print the two results.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>I've got three implementations of this program to show you -- one in C# and two in F#.</p>

<h2>C#</h2>

<p>Here's the C# version I started with:</p>

<pre class="screen">
using System;
using System.IO;

using SQLitePCL;

public class foo
{
    // helper functions to check SQLite result codes and throw

    private static bool is_error(int rc)
    {
        return (
                (rc != raw.SQLITE_OK)
                &amp;&amp; (rc != raw.SQLITE_ROW)
                &amp;&amp; (rc != raw.SQLITE_DONE)
           );
    }

    private static void check(int rc)
    {
        if (is_error(rc))
        {
            throw new Exception(string.Format("{0}", rc));
        }
    }

    private static void check(sqlite3 conn, int rc)
    {
        if (is_error(rc))
        {
            throw new Exception(raw.sqlite3_errmsg(conn));
        }
    }

    private static int checkthru(sqlite3 conn, int rc)
    {
        if (is_error(rc))
        {
            throw new Exception(raw.sqlite3_errmsg(conn));
        }
        else
        {
            return rc;
        }
    }

    // MAIN program

    public static void Main()
    {
        sqlite3 conn = null;

        // ONE: open the db and create the table

        check(raw.sqlite3_open(":memory:", out conn));

        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_exec(conn, "CREATE TABLE foo (a int, b int)"));

        // TWO: insert 16 rows

        for (int i=1; i&lt;=16; i++)
        {
            string sql = string.Format("INSERT INTO foo (a) VALUES ({0})", i);
            check(conn, raw.sqlite3_exec(conn, sql));
        }

        // THREE: set b = a squared and find b for a=7

        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_exec(conn, "UPDATE foo SET b = a * a"));

        sqlite3_stmt stmt = null;
        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_prepare_v2(conn, "SELECT b FROM foo WHERE a=?", out stmt));

        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_bind_int(stmt, 1, 7));
        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_step(stmt));
        int vsq = raw.sqlite3_column_int(stmt, 0);
        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_finalize(stmt));
        stmt = null;

        // FOUR: fetch sum(a) for all rows where b &lt; 120

        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_prepare_v2(conn, "SELECT a FROM foo WHERE b&lt;120", out stmt));

        int vsum = 0;

        while (raw.SQLITE_ROW == (checkthru(conn, raw.sqlite3_step(stmt))))
        {
            vsum += raw.sqlite3_column_int(stmt, 0);
        }
        
        check(conn, raw.sqlite3_finalize(stmt));
        stmt = null;

        // FIVE: close and print the results

        check(raw.sqlite3_close(conn));
        conn = null;

        Console.WriteLine("val: {0}", vsq);
        Console.WriteLine("sum: {0}", vsum);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>I'm coding against the 'raw' SQLite API, which returns integer error codes
rather than throwing exceptions.  So I've written some little check functions
which throw on any result code that signifies an error condition.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the first stanza, I'm opening ":memory:" rather than an actual file on
disk so that I can be sure the db starts clean.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the second stanza, I'm constructing the SQL string rather than using
parameter substitution.  This is a bad idea for two reasons.  First, parameter
substitution eliminates SQL injection attacks.  Second, forcing SQLite to
compile a SQL statement inside a loop is going to cause poor performance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the third stanza, I'm going out of my way to do this more properly, using
prepare/bind/step/finalize.  Ironically, this is the case where it doesn't
matter as much, since I'm not looping.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the fourth stanza, I specifically want to loop over the rows in C#
even though I could easily just do the sum in SQL.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>F#, first attempt</h2>

<p>OK, now here's a painfully direct translation of this code to F#:</p>

<pre class="screen">
open SQLitePCL

// helper functions to check SQLite result codes and throw

let is_error rc = 
    (rc &lt;&gt; raw.SQLITE_OK) 
    &amp;&amp; (rc &lt;&gt; raw.SQLITE_ROW) 
    &amp;&amp; (rc &lt;&gt; raw.SQLITE_DONE)

let check1 rc = 
    if (is_error rc) 
    then failwith (sprintf "%d" rc) 
    else ()

let check2 conn rc = 
    if (is_error rc) 
    then failwith (raw.sqlite3_errmsg(conn)) 
    else ()

let checkthru conn rc = 
    if (is_error rc) 
    then failwith (raw.sqlite3_errmsg(conn)) 
    else rc

// MAIN program

// ONE: open the db and create the table

let (rc,conn) = raw.sqlite3_open(":memory:") 
check1 rc

check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_exec (conn, "CREATE TABLE foo (a int, b int)"))

// TWO: insert 16 rows

for i = 1 to 16 do 
    let sql = (sprintf "INSERT INTO foo (a) VALUES (%d)" i)
    check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_exec (conn, sql ))

// THREE: set b = a squared and find b for a=7

check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_exec (conn, "UPDATE foo SET b = a * a"))

let rc2,stmt = raw.sqlite3_prepare_v2(conn, "SELECT b FROM foo WHERE a=?")
check2 conn rc2

check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_bind_int(stmt, 1, 7))
check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_step(stmt))
let vsq = raw.sqlite3_column_int(stmt, 0)
check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_finalize(stmt))

// FOUR: fetch sum(a) for all rows where b &lt; 120

let rc3,stmt2 = raw.sqlite3_prepare_v2(conn, "SELECT a FROM foo WHERE b&lt;120")
check2 conn rc3

let mutable vsum = 0

while raw.SQLITE_ROW = ( checkthru conn (raw.sqlite3_step(stmt2)) ) do 
    vsum &lt;- vsum + (raw.sqlite3_column_int(stmt2, 0))

check2 conn (raw.sqlite3_finalize(stmt2))

// FIVE: close and print the results

check1 (raw.sqlite3_close(conn))

printfn "val: %d" vsq
printfn "sum: %d" vsum
</pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>The is_error function actually looks kind of elegant to me in this form.  Note
that != is spelled &lt;&gt;.  Also there is no return keyword, as the value of
the last expression just becomes the return value of the function.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The F# way is to use type inference.  For example, in the is_error function, the rc parameter is strongly typed as an integer even though I haven't declared it that way.  The F# compiler looks at the function and sees that I am comparing the parameter against raw.SQLITE_OK, which is an integer, therefore rc must be an integer as well.  F# does have a syntax for declaring the type explicitly, but this is considered bad practice.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The check2 and checkthru functions are identical except that one returns the
unit type (which is kind of like void) and
the other passes the integer argument through.  In C# this wouldn't matter and
I could have just had the check functions return their argument when they don't
throw.  But F# gives warnings ("This expression should have type 'unit', but has type...") for any expression whose values is not used.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In C#, I overloaded check() so that I could sometimes call it with the sqlite3 connection handle and sometimes without.  F# doesn't do function overloading, so I did two versions of the function called check1 and check2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Since raw.sqlite3_open() has an out parameter, F# automatically converts
this to return a tuple with two items (the actual return value is first, and
the value in the out parameter is second).  It took me a little while to figure
out the right syntax to get the two parts into separate variables.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It took me even longer to figure out that calling a .NET method in F# uses a
different syntax than calling a regular F# function.  I was just getting used to
the idea that F# wants functions to be called without parens and with the
parameters separated by spaces instead of commas.  But .NET methods are not F#
functions.  The syntax
for calling a .NET method is, well, just like in C#.  Parens and commas.</p> 
</li>

<li>
<p>Here's another way that method calls are different in F#:  When a method call is a
parameter to a regular F# function, you have to enclose it in parens.  That's
why the call to sqlite3_exec() in the first stanza is parenthesized when I pass
it to check2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BTW, one of the first things I did was try to call raw.sqlite3_Open(), just
to verify that F# is case-sensitive.  It is.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>F# programmers seem to pride themselves on how much they can do in a single line of code, regardless of how long it is.
I originally wrote the second stanza in a single
line.  I only split it up so it would look better here in my blog article.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the third stanza, F# wouldn't let me reuse rc ("Duplicate definition of
value 'rc'") so I had to introduce rc2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the fourth stanza, I have tried to exactly mimic the behavior of the C#
code, and I think I've succeeded so thoroughly that any real F# programmer will
be tempted to gouge their eyes out when they see it.  I've used mutable and
while/do, both of which are considered a very un-functional way of doing
things.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Bottom line:  This code works and it does exactly what the original C# does.
But I named the file fsharp_dreadful.fs because I think that in terms of what is
considered best practices in the F# world, it's probably about as
bad as it can be while still being correct.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>F#, somewhat less csharpy</h2>

<p>Here's an F# version I called fsharp_less_bad.fs.  It's still not very good,
but I've made an attempt to do some things in a more F#-ish way.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>I changed is_error to use pattern matching.  For this very simple situation,
I'm not sure this is an improvement over the simple boolean expression I had
before.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I get the impression that typical doctrine in functional programming church is to not use
exceptions, but I'm not tackling that problem here.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I got rid of checkthru and just made check2 return its rc paraemter when it doesn't
throw.  This means most of the times I call check2 I have to ignore the result
or else I get a warning.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I added a couple of checkpair functions.  These are designed to take a
tuple, such as the one that comes from a .NET method with an out parameter, like sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_prepare_v2().
The checkpair function does the appropriate check function on the first part of
the tuple (the integer return code) and then returns the second part.  The
sort-of clever thing here is that checkpair does not care what type the second
part of the tuple is.  I get the impression that this sort of "things are
generic by default" philosophy is a pillar of functuonal programming.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I added several functions which wrap raw.sqlite3_whatever() as a more F#-like function that looks less cluttered.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the first stanza, after I get the connection open, I define an exec function
using the F# partial application feature.  The exec function is basically just
the sqlite3_exec function except that the conn parameter has already been
baked in.  This allows me to use very readable syntax like <tt>exec "whatever"</tt>.  I considered doing this for all the functions, but I'm
not really sure this design is a good idea.  I just found this hammer called "partial
application" so I was looking for a nail.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the second stanza, I've eliminated the for loop in favor of a list
operation.  I defined a function called ins which inserts one row.  The [1 .. 16] syntax produces a range, which is piped into List.iter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The third stanza looks a lot cleaner with all the .NET method calls hidden
away.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the fourth stanza, I still have a while loop, but I was able to get rid
of mutable.  The syntax I'm using here is (I think) something called a computation
expression.  Basically, the stuff inside the square brackets is constructing a
list with a while loop.  Then List.sum is called on that list, resulting in the
number I want.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<p>I did all this using the command-line F# tools and Mono on a Mac.
I've got a command called fsharpc on my system.
I'm not sure how it got there, but it probably happened when I installed Xamarin.</p>

<p>Since I'm not using msbuild or NuGet, I just harvested SQLitePCL.raw.dll from the SQLitePCL.raw NuGet
package.  The net45 version is compatible with Mono,
and on a Mac, it will simply P/Invoke from the
SQLite library that comes preinstalled with MacOS X.</p>

<p>So the bash commands to setup my environment for this blog entry looked
something like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
mkdir fs_sqlite
cd fs_sqlite
mkdir unzipped
cd unzipped
unzip ~/Downloads/sqlitepcl.raw_needy.0.5.0.nupkg 
cd ..
cp unzipped/lib/net45/SQLitePCL.raw.dll .
</pre>

<p>Here are the build commands I used:</p>

</pre>

<p>BTW, I noticed that compiling F# (fsharpc) is a LOT slower than compiling C#
(gmcs).</p>

<p>Note that the command-line flag to reference (-r:) an assembly is the same
for F# as it is for C#.</p>

<p>Note that fsharp_dreadful.exe is bigger than csharp.exe, and the
"less_bad" exe is even bigger.  I suspect that generalizing these
observations would be extrapolating from too little data.</p>

<p>C# fans may notice that I [attempted to] put more effort into the F# code.
This was intentional.  Making the C# version beautiful was not the point of
this blog entry.</p>
