<p>As an entrepreneur, I like to try new things.&nbsp; Or in other
words, I like to throw a lot of spaghetti against the wall and see what
sticks.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>A few months ago we added support for "coupon codes" to the
SourceGear store, but we've never actually used them.&nbsp; I think it's time to
throw this piece of spaghetti against the wall and see what happens.</p>

<p>If you're placing an order in the SourceGear store during
the month of May, try using this coupon code for a 20% discount:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Eric-May-2006</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional notes:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Think of yourself as a beta tester of this feature of our
     store.&nbsp; Except for our own internal testing, nobody has ever used this
     feature before.&nbsp; We think it works, but let's not be too surprised if we
     end up getting surprised.</li>
 <li >Coupon discounts may not be combined with any other
     discount.</li>
 <li >Coupon discounts may be used only when purchasing directly
     through the SourceGear store website, not through a reseller.</li>
 <li >This coupon is valid only for sales which happen during
     the month of May, 2006.</li>
</ul>

<p>This coupon and its discount are real, but the purpose here
is to see what I can learn from the experience.&nbsp; I'll report back later on how
this works out.</p>
