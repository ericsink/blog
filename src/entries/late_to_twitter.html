<p>OK, so I finally created a <a
href="http://twitter.com/eric_sink">Twitter account</a>.</p>

<p>I might have done this earlier if there weren't some nitwit
squatting the "ericsink" user name.&nbsp; I considered registering as the National
Waffle Institute and posting "French Toast Sucks" as my first tweet, but in the
end I settled for "eric_sink".</p>

<p>I've been on Facebook for quite a while.&nbsp; I apologize for
turning down all the friend requests from blog readers, but I mostly just use
Facebook for family stuff.&nbsp; Unfortunately that means Facebook is a lousy place
for me to make snarky comments about the technology world.&nbsp; Most of my friends
there either don't get it or don't care.</p>

<p>But Twitter should fill this hole in my life nicely.&nbsp; Now,
when it occurs to me that my German Shepherd is smarter, bigger and
better-looking than Spolsky's <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/14.html">husky</a> will ever
be, I can just let the world know immediately, and everyone will be better off.</p>

<p>At first I was worried about the length limit, but I've been
practicing, and it is surprising how often 140 characters are enough.&nbsp; For
example, this one leaves plenty of room to spare:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Everything Borland ever created is
now owned by someone who will destroy it.</p>

<p>But some of my practice tweets didn't go so well.&nbsp; This one
is way over the limit, but I could probably make the point without being so
wordy:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Imagine what the software industry
would be like if Bjarne Stroustrup had chosen a career with less potential for
harm to the world, such as the intentional destruction of all tropical
rainforests.</p>

<p>For me Twitter looks like a solution at the intersection of
two problems.&nbsp; With verbal remarks, it's easy to speak before thinking, but it
just doesn't scale.&nbsp; With blogging, I can reach lots of people, but I always
end up thinking carefully before I post.&nbsp; Twitter allows me to spew hasty,
poorly-thought-out observations to a potentially worldwide audience.&nbsp; I'm
obviously a newbie, but that seems like a great feature.</p>
