<p>Google made a nice splash last week by announcing Google <a
href="http://www.google.com/codesearch">Code Search</a>, which allows searching
public source code.&nbsp; Cool.</p>

<p>Google is big and powerful, so everything they do gets lots
of press.&nbsp; But to be fair, it should be noted that Google wasn't first in this
market.&nbsp; Several other players were up and running before Google's offering:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><a href="http://www.koders.com/">Koders</a></li>
 <li ><a href="http://www.krugle.com/">Krugle</a></li>
 <li ><a href="http://www.codase.com/">Codase</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, from my own highly biased perspective, <i>none</i>
of the above was first to market.&nbsp; As far as I know, the first source code
search engine was <a href="http://www.codecatalog.com/">CodeCatalog</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, if you just clicked on the link to visit
CodeCatalog.com, you found a squatter page.&nbsp; CodeCatalog is now gone.&nbsp; In fact,
its life was rather short, but it predated all the current players by five
years or so.</p>

<p><img width=114 height=104 src="/scm/1630_image001.gif"
align=left hspace=12>CodeCatalog was a pet project of mine back in late 1999
and early 2000.&nbsp; I got rather obsessed with the idea of source code search
engine.&nbsp; I'm sure I was supposed to be acting more like a CEO of SourceGear,
but instead I was hacking on parsers and indexers.&nbsp; CodeCatalog was like my
personal skunk works project.&nbsp; I designed and wrote the code.&nbsp; I coordinated
the marketing splash.&nbsp; I was the sales guy who closed the deal.&nbsp; The whole
thing was a reckless risk, but it turned out very well for SourceGear.</p>

<p>The front end for CodeCatalog was built with <a
href="http://www.zope.com/">Zope</a>.&nbsp; IIRC, the backend was written in Java.</p>

<p>Performance issues were tricky, and I was only indexing
around 20 million lines of code.&nbsp; The current players are handling ten times
that amount or more.&nbsp; Nonetheless, most of my development time was spent making
sure that searches were blazingly fast.</p>

<p>I never really intended to run a source code search engine
as a business.&nbsp; My goal was to unveil CodeCatalog with a gaudy launch at
LinuxWorld Expo in February 2000 at the Javits convention center in New York.&nbsp; All the big Linux and Open Source players would be there.&nbsp; We would draw lots of
attention to CodeCatalog and then sell it to somebody like SourceForge for big
bucks.</p>

<p><img width=155 height=300 src="/scm/1630_image002.gif"
align=right hspace=12>We decided to build the brand identity for CodeCatalog
around a cartoon mascot.&nbsp; We hired a cartoonist to draw a robotic dog.&nbsp; We
named him Cody.</p>

<p>At LinuxWorld, Cody was everywhere.&nbsp; We did big splashy
booth graphics and printed thousands of T-shirts.</p>

<p>And we even brought Cody himself.&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; The role of
Cody was played by a Sony Aibo. &nbsp;We gave the dog away as a raffle prize one the
last day of the show.&nbsp; Back then, Aibos were relatively new and difficult to
find.&nbsp; I had to buy one on eBay.</p>

<p>As it turns out, things worked out very much like we
planned, but not exactly.</p>

<p>Some time before LinuxWorld Expo, we crossed paths with a
company called OpenAvenue.&nbsp; Long story short, we closed a <a
href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59127218.html">deal</a> to sell CodeCatalog
to OpenAvenue just before the LinuxWorld show.&nbsp; I should not disclose the sale
price, but I will say that it was a big enough bag of cash that we have no
regrets.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, OpenAvenue languished.&nbsp; Their business was
very roughly in the same space as SourceForge and CollabNet, but they just
didn't get enough traction.&nbsp; Ultimately, OpenAvenue went out of business and
took CodeCatalog down with them.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, OpenAvenue met their financial
obligations to SourceGear even as their own company was going through a very
difficult financial struggle.&nbsp; I was very grateful to their CEO Paul Hessinger
for that.</p>

<p>Paul and I have not kept in touch, but I just did a Google
search and discovered that he is <a
href="http://www.inrule.com/Management_Team.aspx">currently</a> CEO of <a
href="http://www.inrule.com/">InRule</a> (they sell a rule engine for .NET).&nbsp;
Their management team page also lists Kate McGowan, who I remember as the
primary marketing person for OpenAvenue.</p>

<p>A search of the Internet Archive Wayback Machine shows that
the earliest archived copy of the CodeCatalog website is from <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000511161508/http:/www.codecatalog.com/">May
2000</a>.&nbsp; The last version was from <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010331034823/http:/codecatalog.com/">March
2001</a>.</p>

<p>If Cody were still alive today, he would be almost six years
old.&nbsp; If the technology and website were actively maintained and improved
throughout that time period, CodeCatalog would probably be quite impressive.&nbsp;
I'm happy with the deal, but I do regret that Cody never reached his potential.</p>

<p>But business realities are what they are, and CodeCatalog is
long forgotten by almost everyone.</p>

<p>Except me.&nbsp; I still have several of the T-shirts, and I
sometimes wear one when I'm just hanging around at home.&nbsp; I guess it's my way
of keeping Cody's memory alive.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
