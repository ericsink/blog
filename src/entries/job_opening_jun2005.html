<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; This position has been <a href="/entries/19sep2005.html">filled</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we <a href="/entries/job_opening_feb2005.html">opened</a> and <a href="/entries/03may2005.html">filled</a> a developer position by advertising it here on my weblog.&nbsp; This approach was a bit experimental for us, but it worked very well, so we'd like to try it again:</p>
<p>If we can find just the right person, we would like to add a Software Developer to our core team here at SourceGear.&nbsp;&nbsp;This position is on our project "Allerton" team, developing add-ons for Visual Studio Team System.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Requirements for this position include:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>You have lots of experience developing in Java</p>
<p>You have experience using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></p>
<p>You have experience using a source control tool</p>
<p>
You have permanent legal right to work in the United States</p>
<p>You have excellent written and spoken English</p>
<p>You are willing to live in Champaign, Illinois </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preferred but not absolutely required:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>You have experience developing Eclipse plugins and/or RCP applications</p>
<p>You have developed apps for Windows, Unix and Macintosh</p>
<p><?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = CD /?>
You have a Bachelor's degree in computer science</p>
<p>
You have installed Visual Studio Team System at least once</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intangible criteria:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>You are a <a href="/No_Programmers.html">developer</a>, not a <a href="/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">programmer</a></p>
<p>You know how to read code, not just write code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About SourceGear</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>SourceGear was founded in 1997.&nbsp; The company is owned by three partners (Corey Steffen, Dan Schreiber, and myself).&nbsp; All three of us have a technical background and are involved in the business full-time, managing the company with a style we think is both visionary and conservative.&nbsp; The company is profitable and growing.</p>
<p>Salary for this position will be commensurate with experience.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we pay better than anybody else in the Champaign area, but don't expect us to match the salary from your San Francisco dot-com job back in 1999.&nbsp; Our benefits package is typical of small companies like ours and includes health insurance and 401K.&nbsp;
Every employee has good equipment and a private office with a door that closes.&nbsp; We have a pool table and a fridge with free soft drinks.
</p>
<p>Champaign is home to the <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois</a>. &nbsp;
People who enjoy all four seasons like the weather here.&nbsp; If you live on the opposite side of town, your commute to work will be 15 minutes.</p>
