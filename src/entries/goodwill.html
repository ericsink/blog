<p><i>(This entry was originally published in the SourceGear
company newsletter in early January.)</i></p>

<p>Last week I went to a nearby CVS drugstore to pick up the
usual necessities. You know, ibuprofen, toothpaste, and monster truck magazines
(I only read the articles).</p>

<p>When I stepped up to the cash register to pay, the cashier
said, &quot;Sorry sir, CVS doesn't support transactions.&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;rimshot/&gt;</p>

<p>Sorry, I couldn't resist.</p>

<p>Actually what happened is all the cashiers were busy, so I
got in line. That store has one of those corrals which feeds multiple
registers, so everybody waits in the same queue. The corral was empty, so I was
next to be served.</p>

<p>Just after I got into the line, a woman stepped up beside
the corral, obviously waiting for a register. I wondered why she didn't use the
corral like I did, but as the woman was clearly in her eighties, I decided not
to fuss.</p>

<p>And then her husband intervened, &quot;No Betsy, we have to
get in line over there&quot;, and he pointed behind me at the entrance to the
corral.</p>

<p>With a vague recollection of my parents once saying
something about respecting my elders, I gestured to offer the older couple my
place in line. Betsy started to smile, but Husband responded firmly, &quot;No
sir, we will get in line.&quot;</p>

<p>Betsy scowled as she walked around and stood in the corral
just behind me.</p>

<p>About this time, a cashier, who had just finished the
tedious process of dealing with some customer from 1985 who insisted on writing
a check, called out, &quot;I can help the next person in line.&quot;</p>

<p>I began to step toward the register, but I was too slow.
With surprising speed and agility for an octegenarian, Betsy stepped around me.</p>

<p>Now I am finally upset. What is this lady's problem? And
what happened to that husband who was keeping her in line?</p>

<p>I seethed quietly, trying to remember how silly I would look
getting into a public argument with someone who looks old enough to have voted
for Lincoln.</p>

<p>As I drove away, my irritation began to change, focusing
less on Betsy and aimed more at myself. What was MY problem? Why did I get so
annoyed over such a little thing?</p>

<p>I don't know Betsy. I don't know why she behaved oddly that
day. Maybe if I did, I would have felt differently. For example, how would I
have felt if someone had told me that she had Alzheimers?</p>

<p>Here at SourceGear, we sell tools to help software teams
work together better. We put a lot of craftsmanship into our products, and we
hope you are finding them to be effective.</p>

<p>But teams need more than tools. Teams are made of people. If
I could sell patience and understanding, I would. (Especially if we could
structure it as a monthly subscription so we could get a recurring revenue
stream.)</p>

<p>All too often, we assume the worst of people.</p>

<p>As we've just wrapped up that time of the year when many
people participate in traditions which emphasize goodwill and peace, may I
offer you this encouragement? Next time someone on your team does something to
irritate you, assume the best of them.</p>
