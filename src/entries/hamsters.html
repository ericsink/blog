<p>I'm assuming the sales clerk burst out laughing as soon as
we left the pet shop.</p>

<p>Wait, let me give a little background here.</p>

<p>My daughter's quest to get a hamster has become rather a
public spectacle, having been mentioned here in a <a
href="/entries/perils_of_wikipedia.html">blog entry</a> as well as
in one of SourceGear's <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/TEM/TEMcomic.html">comic
books</a>.&nbsp; Anyway, her birthday was this weekend, so it seemed like time.</p>

<p>The Champaign Petsmart is designated as "male hamsters
only".&nbsp; In retrospect, perhaps we should have gone there.&nbsp; But so many people
encouraged us to "buy local" that we decided to visit <a
href="http://www.sailfin.com/">Sailfin Pet Shop</a>, just down the street from
SourceGear's offices.</p>

<p>In Sailfin's defense, I would like to say that they provided
us with a good price and excellent service.&nbsp; In this case, "excellent service"
means that they kept a straight face when we asked if the hamster could be
pregnant.</p>

<p>You see, Lydia wanted a <i>white</i> hamster.&nbsp; No other
color would do.&nbsp; And there was only one white hamster in the store.&nbsp; And it was
a female.&nbsp; So we bought it anyway, but not without asking the otherwise very
helpful sales clerk if there was <i>any</i> possibility that "Spunky" could be
pregnant.&nbsp; With no facial expression at all, he looked at the hamster and said,
"Yes, that is possible."</p>

<p>Eighteen hours later when our family's talk of the hamster
abruptly switched to the plural, it became extremely clear that this sales
clerk not only knew darn well that Spunky was knocked up, but he could probably
tell at a glance that she was in early labor.&nbsp; I mean seriously.&nbsp; We brought
the rodent home one afternoon and she was pushing out offspring the next
morning.&nbsp; The Sailfin guy does this for a living -- he <i>had</i> to know.</p>

<p>In contrast, I don't know anything about hamsters.&nbsp; All I
know is that if the current birth rate of one new generation every day
continues, I will have hundreds of billions of these little tribbles by
Christmas, so there will be plenty to share.</p>

<p>So, if any of you would like to bless the geek in your life
with the gift of a hamster at the holidays, please let me know.&nbsp; No charge, as
long as you come to Champaign and pick up the rodent in person.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you would prefer not to travel to Illinois just to pick up a five dollar furball, consider gifting one of <a
href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2008/11/25/what-do-you-buy-a-programmer-for-christmas">Andy
Brice's geek T-shirts</a> instead.&nbsp; They're nice shirts, the proceeds are going
to charity, and they've gotta be less hassle than a hamster.</p>
