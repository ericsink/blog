title: Best Buy:  I want a Quiet Zone card.

<p>I first started shopping at Best Buy maybe 10 or 15 years
ago.&nbsp; It was either them or Circuit City, and back then, Best Buy was the clear
winner.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because Circuit City's employees were always trying to sell me a
service contract.&nbsp; Shopping at Best Buy was relatively painless, so I became a
regular customer there.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2007 and everything has changed.&nbsp; Circuit City is no longer even a viable alternative.&nbsp; Based on the store here in Champaign, I'd say the chain has mostly flatlined.&nbsp; I hope their stockholders signed some
sort of a Do-Not-Resuscitate order.</p>

<p>So Best Buy is really the only choice I've got.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
Best Buy today is far, far more annoying than Circuit City ever was.&nbsp; I regret
that I ever complained about the teensy little hassle at Circuit City.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >No, I don't want 8 free issues of Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;
     I've been asked this question dozens if not hundreds of times, and the
     answer has always been "no". <br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >No, I don't want to buy an extended warranty.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; If
     my new DVD player stops working in three years, I'll just buy a new one.&nbsp;
     Really.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >No, I don't want a Best Buy credit card.&nbsp; My current card
     works just fine, but I swear, if you ask me this question one more time
     I'm going to go get a credit card from Circuit City just so I can tick you
     off by using it whenever I shop here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I got asked about the service contract THREE TIMES
during the purchase of a single item.</p>

<p>In terms of not being pestered, walking through a Chevrolet
dealership is safer than a trip to Best Buy.</p>

<p>I'll confess that I do have one of their Reward Zone cards.&nbsp;
Care to hear how I got it?&nbsp; Glad you asked.&nbsp; I was buying a DVD one day,
preparing to tell them for the fifty thousandth time that I <i>really</i> don't
want a Reward Zone card.&nbsp; But this time the cashier deviated from the script.&nbsp;
She picked up a fresh new Reward Zone package and said, "I see you in here all
the time.&nbsp; You need one of these."&nbsp; And suddenly I had a Reward Zone card,
whether I wanted one or not.</p>

<p>I want the old Best Buy back.&nbsp; I just want to buy DVDs and
cordless phones and digital cameras without being asked any questions.&nbsp; And I
have a plan.</p>

<p>What I want is a Best Buy "Quiet Zone" card.&nbsp; Instead of
blue like the Reward Zone card, this one would be red.&nbsp; I have no idea how my
Reward Zone card works, but my Quiet Zone card would work like this:&nbsp; Whenever
a Best Buy employee sees it, they immediately shut up.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; All I have
to do is wave my red card and suddenly every blue shirt in my vicinity will put
a cork in it.&nbsp; Don't even finish your sentence.&nbsp; I am buying exactly what I came
here to buy, and nothing else.</p>

<p>I'd love to assert that the Red Zone card should be free,
but I suspect that selling the idea of pleasing customers to the Best Buy
management would be like trying to sell air freshener to a fish.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is that I would be willing to pay for
my Quiet Zone card.&nbsp; I understand the realities of business.&nbsp; I know that
nothing really comes for free.&nbsp; I know that the reason you people keep trying
to give me magazines is that somebody is paying you to do it, so I am willing
to pay you to stop.&nbsp; Charge me an annual fee.&nbsp; Or charge me a higher price
every time I use my Quiet Zone card.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; Just shut your pie hole.</p>

<p>Frankly, I think this idea is the best solution for everybody
involved.&nbsp; The only possible flaw in my plan is that someday a new Best Buy
competitor will emerge.&nbsp; They'll have a similar selection of products.&nbsp; Their
prices will be 3-5 percent higher, but they will never, ever try to sell me
something I didn't come there to buy.&nbsp; On the day that store opens in Champaign, I will make my last stop at Best Buy to say farewell.</p>

<p>But for now, please, please, sell me a Quiet Zone card.</p>
