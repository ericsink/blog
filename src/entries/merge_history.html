<p>One of the popular complaints about CVS and Subversion
(before 1.5) was the lack of merge history.&nbsp; In a nutshell, merge history is
remembering what has been merged and taking that information into account on
future merges.</p>

<h2>In a bucket?</h2>

<p>In something bigger than a nutshell, merge history is a lot
more complicated.</p>

<p>Unless you completely eschew branching, you are going to
frequently find yourself wanting to take some changes you made in one place and
re-apply them somewhere else.&nbsp; When you do this, you want your version control
to make it painless.&nbsp; Without merge history, it is very difficult to make
change migration painless, since the tool will try to do things that have
already been done.</p>

<p>A common example is the case of two branches that
occasionally want to merge changes from one side to the other.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=450
height=761 src="/scm/1764_image001.jpg"></p>

<p>Here I have two branches of development.&nbsp; On two occasions,
somebody merged changes from branch (b) over to branch (a).&nbsp; (Arrows go from a
changeset to its parents.)</p>

<p>Without merge history, this can be a real pain.&nbsp; When branch
(a) tries to grab changes from changeset 5b, CVS doesn't remember that 3b and
2b have already been applied. So it attempts to apply them a second time,
resulting in conflicts, pain and frustration and a general fear of branching.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about DAG-based version control
tools is that the DAG is an expression of merge history.&nbsp; We interpret arrows
in the DAG to mean "'I've got this".</p>

<p>So, when it comes time to do merge from 5b over to the (a)
branch, we can use information in the DAG to know that 3b and 2b are already
done.&nbsp; I'm not saying the algorithm to use this information properly is
trivial, but there are multiple implementations, and they work pretty well in
practice.</p>

<p>For example, Git has a repuation for excellent and painless
branching and merging, and the DAG is the main reason why.</p>

<h2>Cherrypicking</h2>

<p>But a DAG is just one implementation of merge history, and
it is definitely not perfect.</p>

<p>An arrow in a verson control DAG goes from child to parent.&nbsp;
It tells us that the child contains all of the changes in the parent.&nbsp; And its
grandparents.&nbsp; And its great grandparents.&nbsp; And so on.</p>

<p>But what if this isn't true?</p>

<p>Consider the following picture:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=450
height=448 src="/scm/1764_image002.jpg"></p>

<p>I want to create changeset 4.&nbsp; I want to start at changeset
1, and then I want to apply the changes from changeset 3, but NOT the stuff in
changeset 2.&nbsp; This operation is sometimes called "cherrypicking".&nbsp; I don't want
to merge all changes from one branch to another.&nbsp; I just want to pluck one
changeset (or one part of a changeset) and apply it as a patch to some other
place.</p>

<p>How do I represent this in the DAG?</p>

<p>I can't.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I could draw an arrow from 4 to 3 (shown above in red).&nbsp;
     This would correctly say that 4 contains the changes in 3, but it would
     INCORRECTLY claim that 4 contains the changes in 2.</li>
 <li >OR, I could draw no arrow.&nbsp; Effectively, my merge history would
     simply not record the fact that 4 is really 3 converted to a patch and
     applied to 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, something bad is going to happen next time I
merge from one branch to the other:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >If I draw that lying arrow, I will not be given the chance
     to apply changeset 2, because the merge history believes I already did it.</li>
 <li >If I don't draw any arrow, the tool will expect me to deal
     with changeset 3, because there is no merge history recording the fact
     that I already did it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these problems is disastrous enough to make the
evening news, but still.</p>

<h2>DAG-Like Things</h2>

<p>It's tempting to think that the problem lies in the way I
defined my DAG lines.&nbsp; Perhaps a line should mean "just you, not your parents?"&nbsp;
But then I would I need to have a line from every changeset to every one of its
ancestors.&nbsp; This would be completely infeasible.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we need two kinds of DAG lines?</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Regular lines are the normal case.&nbsp; They imply recursive
     inclusion.&nbsp; We'll draw them in black.</li>
 <li >Red lines are for cherrypicking.&nbsp; When a red line points
     to a changeset, it says, "I've got this, but not its ancestors."&nbsp; Red
     lines imply shallow inclusion.</li>
</ul>

<p>But now our DAG is not really a DAG anymore.&nbsp; If we're going
to use a DAG, we'd like to be able to use the decades of computer science
research about how to deal with them.&nbsp; AFAIK, all the well understood
algorithms about DAGs assume there is only one kind of line.</p>

<p>For example, is changeset 3 a leaf?&nbsp; Well, maybe.&nbsp; If you
ignore the red lines, then 3 is a leaf.&nbsp; But if red lines count, then 3 is an
interior node.</p>

<p>Many CS algorithms become less useful when questions start
getting answered with "maybe".</p>

<h2>Darcs</h2>

<p>So, even though the DAG is a pretty good representation of
merge history, it isn't perfect.</p>

<p><a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> is an attempt to build
a better solution to the problem.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago I <a
href="/entries/dvcs_dag_1.html">divided</a> version control
tools into two groups:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Those where the history is a Line.</li>
 <li >Those where the history is a Directed Acyclic Graph (a
     DAG).</li>
</ol>

<p>But darcs doesn't really fit in either of these categories.&nbsp;
Its model of history is certainly not a Line.&nbsp; But it's not really a DAG
either, at least not in the same way as Git and Mercurial.</p>

<p>A darcs changeset records the full merge history at the
patch level.&nbsp; Darcs has a nice well-defined algebra of patches which allows it
to accomplish some very clever things.</p>

<p>But while I consider the concepts behind Darcs to be
fascinating, I also consider them to be raw and unproven in practice.&nbsp; I can't
see how the algorithm would scale to big problems.&nbsp; And people who know darcs
are always talking about the possibility of the merge algorithm going <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=darcs+exponential+merge">exponential</a>. </p>

<p>Darcs seems to have a more complete representation for merge
history.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean there is any practical algorithm for making use
of that information.</p>

<p>For now, I must consider darcs to be in the category of research,
not development.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Merge history is a very hard problem.&nbsp; Some of the imperfect
solutions have found their way into common usage and proven themselves to be
quite practical.&nbsp; But there is a lot more that could be done.</p>

<p>Need a thesis topic for your PhD in computer science?&nbsp; Go
find a better solution to the merge history problem.</p>
