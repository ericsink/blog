<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I'm not sure what I expected when I wrote this blog entry.  I just
figured I would "throw it out there" and see what happened.
Maybe the Xamarin.Forms team would talk about my idea at their next standup.
</p>

<p>What actually happened is that within an hour, Jason Smith (the lead
developer of Xamarin.Forms) invited me to a Skype call, shared his
screen, brought up The Code, and we talked about ways it could be
improved.</p>

<p>I didn't expect <b>that</b>.</p>

<p>(But it was glorious, as nerd conversations about
code so often are.)</p>

<p>The discussion gave me a decent idea of what kind of changes
Jason intended to make, but I don't think it is my place to say
more about the details.
Suffice it to say that I'm probably not getting exactly
what I suggested, but it looks like I'll be getting what I need.
If Jason and his team end up confirming the viability of the changes
he and I discussed, then it will definitely become possible to get
much better performance in a Xamarin.Forms app.
</p>

<p>Anyway, huge kudos and thanks to Jason for a response I consider
way "above and beyond the call".</p>

<h2>And the #1 problem is...</h2>

<p>It's slow.</p>

<h2>To be fair...</h2>

<p>It's not <b>always</b> slow.  There are plenty of use cases where it works fine.</p>

<p>And not <b>all</b> of Xamarin.Forms is slow.  The biggest offender is the layout system.</p>

<p>But this can be a pretty big problem.  
It's not too hard to find <a href="http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/68637">stories</a> 
of people who gave up on
Xamarin.Forms simply because there was no way to make their app perform
acceptably.</p>

<h2>Positive remarks to balance my complaining</h2>

<p>Xamarin.Forms is terribly exciting.  I've spent much of the last three
months working with it, and I love it.  Like any young technology trying to
solve very hard problems, it has plenty of rough edges.  But it shows high
potential for awesomeness.</p>

<p>And <b>lots</b> of people seem to agree.  In fact, I daresay that the
level of excitement around Xamarin.Forms has taken some people at Xamarin by surprise.  
I can't
quote verbatim, but I'm pretty sure I heard somebody at Evolve say that they
changed their plans for the training and sessions to include a lot more Xamarin.Forms content because of
the buzz.</p>

<p>People want this technology.  And they want it to be great.</p>

<p>That's my goal in writing this piece.  I just want to help make Xamarin.Forms great.</p>

<h2>BTW</h2>

<p>If the code were open source, this blog entry would be a pull request.  And
it wouldn't be my only one.</p>

<p>Someone has made the decision to <b>not</b> open source Xamarin.Forms, and I shall
not criticize or second-guess this choice.  But I can't resist saying that if it
were open source, I would be actively spending my time helping make it better.</p>

<h2>This is a very difficult problem</h2>

<p>Cross-platform stuff is really hard.  And if you add "UI" into the previous sentence then
you have to add a least two more "reallys".</p>

<p>I've been doing cross platform development for a long time.  I've used dozens
of different UI toolkits and APIs.  After you master the first ten, they all
start to look the same.</p>

<p>Until you try to wrap them in a common API, and then the differences stop
whispering and start screaming.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms is venturing into territory where dozens of others have
failed.  We're going to have to be patient.</p>

<h2>But good grief the layout code is slow</h2>

<p>Seriously.  Write something non-trivial with Xamarin.Forms and then bring it up under a profiler.</p>

<h2>But that's okay...</h2>

<p>... for two reasons.  

<ul>
    <li><p>The layout code is doing a lot of work for you.  I don't mind code that
    takes time when it's doing stuff I need done.  That's life.  The layout
    system is powerful, and convenience always comes at a price.</p></li>
    <li><p>The code will get better.  I've spent an awful lot of time reading
    Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll in the Xamarin Studio Assembly Browser.  This code
    simply hasn't had much attention given to optimizaiton yet.  When it does,
    it will get faster.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not complaining about the layout code being slow.  I'm complaining that
I <b>always</b> have to use it.</p>

<h2>Child views vs. Layouts</h2>

<p>The real problem here is that Xamarin.Forms gives you no way to have child
views without using a subclass of Layout.
What I want is the ability to write a subclass of View that can have child
views.</p>

<p>Right now I can do something like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
public class myParentView : Layout&lt;View&gt;
{
    private Rectangle getBox(View child)
    {
        // whatever
    }

    protected override void LayoutChildren (double x, double y, double width, double height)
    {
        foreach (View v in Children) {
            Rectangle r = getBox (v);
            v.Layout (r);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>But for some situations, the Layout system is just way too much.  Events
propagating up and down.  Height
and width requests.  Real estate negotiations between every child view and its
parent.</p>

<p>And for the sake of making sure the layout always gets updated when it
needs to be, the code triggers a layout cycle in response to, well, almost
everything.</p>

<p>Add or remove a child view?  Relayout everything.</p>

<p>Here's my favorite:  Put a Label in a Frame in a StackLayout
in another StackLayout in a ScrollView in a Whatever.  The details
don't matter.  Just build a hierarchy several levels deep with a
Label down near the bottom.  Then change the Text property of that
label from "foo" to "bar".  This triggers a layout cycle, because
the label might want to request more size, and the parent might
want to care about that request, so the whole negotiation starts over.</p>

<p>For extra fun, bind that Label's Text property to something that
is also bound to the Text property of an Entry.  Now you can trigger
a complete relayout on every keystroke.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms currently suffers from a problem that is very typical
for cross-platform UI toolkits at the toddler stage:  It is constantly
triggering layout updates "just in case" one might be needed.  In
general, it is better to have your forums filled with people saying
"layout is slow" rather than people saying "I changed something and 
layout didn't update".</p>

<h2>We need a lower-level mechanism</h2>

<p>I would like to rewrite my example above to look
something like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
public class myParentView : View
{
    private List<View> myChildren;

    private Rectangle getBox(View child)
    {
        // whatever
    }

    public LayoutMyChildren()
    {
        foreach (View v in myChildren) {
            Rectangle r = getBox (v);
            v.Layout (r);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<ul>
    <li><p>Instead of subclassing Layout<View>, I have subclassed View.</p></li>
    <li><p>Since I no longer inherit a Children collection, I have defined my own.</p></li>
    <li><p>Whereas previously I did an override of the abstract
    LayoutChildren() method, now I just provide a method called
    LayoutMyChildren().</p></li>
    <li><p>Whenever I know I need to arrange all my child views,
    instead of triggering a layout cycle, I call LayoutMyChildren().</p></li>
    <li><p>If I only need to arrange some of my child views, I can write a method that does less work.</p></li>
    <li><p>Not shown, but I probably need to override OnSizeAllocated() and call LayoutMyChildren().</p></li>
    <li><p>Since I own myChildren, inserts and deletes from this collection
    will not automatically trigger a layout cycle.  If anything needs to
    updated when my set of child views changes, I have to do that myself.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, I don't want any help laying things out.  I just want
the ability to have child views, and I don't want anybody meddling with
my right to parent those children however I see fit.</p>

<p>A full implementation of myParentView is going to be rather complicated.
But it's going to be <b>fast</b>, because myParentView has all the knowledge
it needs to allow it to make smart decisions and avoid doing things that
don't need to be done.</p>

<h2>The design of child views in Xamarin.Forms</h2>

<p>The concept of "child views" should be
be distinct from the concept of "deciding where those child views should
be placed".  Thinking over the various UI toolkits I have used, the separation of
these two concepts is a common pattern.</p>

<p>But the example above doesn't work in Xamarin.Forms 1.2.  My child views never get a renderer
assigned to them, so they never show up.  The element hierarchy on the PCL
side is fine.  It just never gets mirrored on the platform side.</p>

<p>When I explained this to a coworker, I said, "The whole idea almost
works.  In fact, it all works, right up until the end, when it doesn't
work at all."</p>

<p>Interestingly, Xamarin.Forms is very close to the design I want it to have.
In researching this problem, I expected to find the child view management
stuff in Xamarin.Forms.Layout, but it's just not there.
As it turns out, the ability to have child views
is actually <b>not</b> specific to Xamarin.Forms.Layout.  Rather, this concept
is implemented in Xamarin.Forms.Element (right where it belongs, IMNSHO).
</p>

<p>The Element class has three important members.  It does not actually
manage a collection of child views.  Rather, it exposes a way for a subclass
to do so.  OnChildAdded() and OnChildRemoved() need to be called when
the child views collection has changed.  These methods set the Parent property
of the new child view, but more importantly, they trigger an event.  The
platform code is listening to this event (in VisualElementPackager), and
that is where child views get their renderer assigned.</p>

<p>So what I need to do is call OnChildAdded() whenever I add something
to myChildren.  Now my layout wannabe class looks like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
public class myParentView : View
{
    private List<View> myChildren;

    private Rectangle getBox(View child)
    {
        // whatever
    }

    private addChild(View child)
    {
        myChildren.Add(child);
        OnChildAdded(child);
    }

    public LayoutMyChildren()
    {
        foreach (View v in myChildren) {
            Rectangle r = getBox (v);
            v.Layout (r);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>And this almost works, but not quite.  As I said above, Element has three
important members which are used to communicate with the renderer about child views.  
The first two (discussed above) are OnChildAdded() and OnChildRemoved().  The 
third one is a property called LogicalChildren.  This property is, well, the
collection of child views.  The two OnChild* methods are just there to keep
things up to do date, but LogicalChildren is the starting point.</p>

<p>So what I need to do in myParentView is just override the LogicalChildren property,
which is virtual.  No problem, right?</p>

<p>Here's the problem:  LogicalChildren is marked "internal", 
so a subclass cannot override it unless it was written by Xamarin.</p>

<h2>My request</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, I am asking the Xamarin.Forms team for the ability to have a View subclass which
can have and manage its own child views without being a subclass of Layout.</p>

<p>My suggested implementation of that idea is to just change Element.LogicalChildren
from "internal" to "protected internal".</p>

<p>And I've spent some time trying to prove that my suggestion would work.  Purely
as a proof of concept, I used Mono.Cecil to create a hacked-up copy of Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll
which has my suggested change:</p>
  
<pre class="screen">
#r "Mono.Cecil.dll"

open Mono.Cecil

let a = AssemblyDefinition.ReadAssembly("Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll")
for t in a.MainModule.Types do
    if t.FullName = "Xamarin.Forms.Element" then
        for p in t.Properties do
            if p.Name = "LogicalChildren" then
                let m = p.GetMethod
                m.IsFamilyOrAssembly <- true
a.Write("Better.Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll")
</pre>

<p>And then I wrote a myParentView class which has an override for LogicalChildren.  The
result is a <b>huge</b> performance increase for my particular use case, because
myParentView doesn't need all the general-purpose stuff that the Layout subclasses provide.
My contention is that there are <b>lots</b> of similar use cases which can
benefit from this approach.</p>

<p>So that's my suggested change, but I don't actually care <b>how</b> this gets
done.  If the Xamarin.Forms team were to ship 1.3 with my "child views without layouts"
concept exposed in some other fashion, I would be just as happy.  </p>

<h2>Moving forward</h2>

<p>The Xamarin.Forms.Layout classes still need to get faster.  And they will.</p>

<p>But regardless of when this happens, the concept of "child views" deserves to exist on
its own.</p>
