<p>If I weren't such a lousy student maybe I would get a
masters degree in business.&nbsp; My graduate thesis would be entitled, "The 21
Questions that People Ask at Trade Shows".&nbsp; You see, I have noticed that all
the visitors to our booths at TechEd and PDC and DevConnections always ask the
same questions.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Why should I switch to Vault?</li>
 <li >How much does it cost?</li>
 <li >Does it integrate with Visual Studio?</li>
</ul>

<p>After going to enough trade shows, we've basically heard
them all.&nbsp; Nobody ever asks anything new.</p>

<p>Except for that time some guy with a Unix beard wanted to
know if we were hiring and do we do criminal background checks and how many
felony convictions are considered acceptable for a new hire.&nbsp; That was ...
different.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the questions we hear at every show is:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Can I use Vault to version control
my SQL stuff?</p>

<p>To which we reply:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Well, no.&nbsp; You see, we could do
this feature, but it would require us to build a whole bunch of SQL-specific
tooling and that would put us in competition with Red Gate and we don't want to
be there because Red Gate is a great company and Neil Davidson and Simon
Galbraith are great guys so it would just be easier if you went over to the Red
Gate booth and asked them to do this and let them know that we'll be available
to help and by the way would you care for one of our free T-shirts?</p>

<p>I am quite pleased to say that, thanks to Red Gate's
efforts, we won't have to give this answer anymore.&nbsp; Earlier this year, they
shipped <a
href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/">SQL
Source Control 2.1</a> which includes integration support for Vault (and
apparently every other prevalent version control tool on the planet).</p>

<p>It is miserable in the extreme for a developer to be working
without good support for version control.&nbsp; If you're doing SQL development,
this is the product you want to use.&nbsp; My compliments to our friends at Red Gate
for meeting this need.</p>
