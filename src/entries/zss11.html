title: ZSS 1.1

<p>Version 1.1 of Zumero for SQL Server (ZSS) is <a href="http://zumero.com/dev-center/zss/">now available</a>.</p>

<p>This release includes lots of bug fixes and polishing improvements.
Version 1.1 also adds compatibility with <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/sql-database/">Windows
Azure SQL Database</a>.</p>  

<p>But the two main improvements of the 1.1 release are (1) server-side filters and
(2) things to make it easier to get started.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>The major new feature in 1.1 is server-side filtering, which allows you to
sync <i>partial</i> tables down to the mobile device.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/entries/zss_filter.png" width="80%"/></p>

<p>A filter can exclude a table or some of its columns.  Or a filter can use a WHERE
clause to exclude rows.  Or both.</p>

<p>Filters can be mapped to users, so that each user can have their mobile
device receive only the information they need.</p>

<p>Example use cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Exclude the [Salary] column from syncs by people who are not allowed to see it.</p></li>
    <li><p>Exclude a large blob/image column to save bandwidth and storage space on the mobile device.</p></li>
    <li><p>Configure row filters such that field sales people only sync down their own leads.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use row filtering to ensure that only the not-yet-completed tasks are sync-ed to mobile devices.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this has been our top feature request.  It is a critical feature for a
replicate-and-sync architecture.  Filtering allows Zumero to be used with large
SQL Server databases without requiring each mobile device to have a copy of unnecessary
data.</p>

<h2>Easier to get started</h2>

<p>A big focus for the 1.1 release has been to make it easier for people to get
started.  We want to remove obstacles and make it painless for people to try Zumero.</p>

<p>First of all, we've got a spiffy new <a href="http://zumero.com/get-started/">Getting Started</a> guide
that holds your hand for the initial config.  This guide provides help with the
most common technical support questions we get from new users.</p>

<p>On the server side, we've made improvements to the installer to help get
everything configured properly.  Perhaps the most important change here is a
simple wizard to build your ODBC connection string for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/entries/zss_build_odbc.png" width="80%"/></p>

<p>Power users can still enter any ODBC string they want.  The builder feature is
simply there for convenience.</p>

<p>On the client side, we've added a Test App (so you can see <i>your</i> data
on a mobile device as quickly as possible), and an App Generator (which will
provide a buildable skeleton app with a UI customized for <i>your</i>
data).</p>

<h2>Test App</h2>

<p>The ZSS Test App lets you verify your setup all the way to a real mobile device.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/entries/zss_test_app.png" width="80%"/></p>

<p>It's a simple client app with basic support for viewing data and
making simple changes.</p>

<p>Currently, the ZSS Test App is Android-only.  An iOS version is on the way.</p>

<h2>App Generator</h2>

<p>The ZSS App Generator (ZAG) is a desktop app which generates source code and
build scripts for a simple, working app that syncs and views data from your SQL
Server database.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/entries/zss_app_generator.png" width="80%"/></p>

<p>Many of our customers are not mobile developers (yet!).  They want ZSS
because they have a bunch of data in SQL Server and they need to build an
app to allow mobile users to interact with it.  This plunges them into
an unfamiliar world of Objective-C and Java and SQLite.</p>

<p>ZAG is a way to get some early traction.  The app generated by ZAG can
be used as a skeleton for your project.
Or simply as customized sample code for copy-and-paste.</p>

<p>Currently, ZAG generates apps only for Android/Java.  Support for other
targets is on the way.  iOS/ObjC will be next.  Since ZAG is very new and there
is so much cool stuff to be done,
it will be moving forward on its own release schedule, not necessarily
in lockstep with the ZSS server and client SDKs.</p>

<h2>Customer Stories</h2>

<p><a href="http://zumero.com/customers/flyingj/"><img src="/entries/flyingj.jpg" align="right" border="0"/></a>Some of our early ZSS customers are wrapping up their first projects, which means we can
begin sharing stories of their success with Zumero.  
Here's one from <a href="http://zumero.com/customers/flyingj/">Pilot Flying J</a>, the largest
operator of travel centers and travel plazas in the United States.</p>
<p>Lately I find myself
preferring to buy gas at the Pilot station not far from my home, but so far
I have resisted the temptation to ask the manager to pull out their iPhone and show me their Zumero-based
apps in action.  <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>Lots more cool Zumero stuff is on the way!</p>
