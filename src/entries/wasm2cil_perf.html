teaser: Very early and very rough comparisons against wasmtime and native
---

<p>(What is wasm2cil?  See my <a href="/entries/wasm_wasi_dotnet.html">previous blog entry</a>.)</p>

<p>I've been trying to do some measurements to get a 
rough idea of performance for assemblies produced by
wasm2cil.</p>

<p>A VERY rough idea.  Take these numbers with a grain of salt.</p>

<h2>Brotli compression</h2>

<p>For a rather CPU-intensive test, the following Brotli library:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dropbox/rust-brotli">https://github.com/dropbox/rust-brotli</a></p>

<p>... makes a nice test case because it compiles to wasm32-unknown-wasi with no problems:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:rust-brotli eric$ cargo +nightly build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-wasi
</pre>

<p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/ericsink/rust-brotli/commit/adbcea7638041c5ea95b4fb33a79208818e079e3">small code change</a> to write out the elapsed time after compressing something.</p>

<p>My test case is measure the time required to compress sqlite3.c (the source code for 
SQLite in a single 7.4 MB "amalgamation" file).</p>

<p>First, I ran the original Rust version natively:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:rust-brotli eric$ cargo run --release --bin brotli -- -c sqlite3.c s1
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.19s
     Running `target/release/brotli -c sqlite3.c s1`
elapsed: 17
</pre>

<p>Second, I ran brotli.wasm through wasmtime:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:wasm2cil eric$ wasmtime --dir=. brotli.wasm -- -c sqlite3.c s1
elapsed: 81
</pre>

<p>Finally, I ran brotli.wasm through my own wasm2cil:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:tool eric$ dotnet run -- run ../brotli.wasm -- -c ../sqlite3.c s1
elapsed: 37
</pre>

<p>Summarized results:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">

<tr align="center">
    <th>Implementation</th>
    <th>Elapsed Time (sec)</th>
    </tr>

<tr align="right">
    <td>native</td>
    <td>17</td>
    </tr>

<tr align="right">
    <td>wasmtime</td>
    <td>81</td>
    </tr>

<tr align="right">
    <td>wasm2cil</td>
    <td>37</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<P>So the wasm2cil version takes over twice as long as the native code.
Hopefully I can narrow that gap with more focused work on performance.</p>

<p>It's a little surprising that wasmtime came in so much slower.  Or
maybe it's not.  The comparison here has a little bit of apples-to-oranges going on.</p>

<p>First of all, WebAssembly memory accesses are supposed
to be range-checked, and wasm2cil isn't currently doing that, while
wasmtime probably is.</p>

<p>Second, we're probably seeing a basic difference in maturity
between Cranelift JIT (which is fairly young) and .NET Core 2.2.</p>

<p>Third, I could be using wasmtime incorrectly, although I did try the --optimize 
flag, and it didn't help.</p>

<p>Finally, this is just one benchmark.  In the next one, 
wasmtime does very well indeed.</p>

<h2>SQLite</h2>

<p>To do some measurements with SQLite, I wrote a little C program
that uses the sqlite3 API to construct a table and query a subset of the rows.
Specifically, given parameters (count), (first) and (last), it
inserts (count) rows, where each row is two columns, the loop index, and the loop index squared.
After the inserts are done, it does a SELECT sum() on the squares
column using (first) and (last) as the range of rows.</p>

<p>In other words, the test program uses SQLite to calculate
something basically equivalent to this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
int total = 0;
for (int i=0; i&lt;count; i++)
{
    if ((i &gt;= first) &amp;&amp; (i &lt;= last))
    {
        total += i * i;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The main() for this test case allows the count, first and last parameters 
to be specified on the command line, 
as well as the name of the sqlite database file.  So I did three runs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1,000 rows; sum the square from 200 through 400</p></li>
<li><p>10,000 rows; sum the square from 2,000 through 4,000</p></li>
<li><p>100,000 rows; sum the square from 20,000 through 40,000</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are those runs for the native code:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:reference eric$ ./a.out z1 1000 200 400
filename=z1  count=1000  first=200  last=400
elapsed: 472 ms
rc: 18766700

erics-mac-mini:reference eric$ ./a.out z2 10000 2000 4000
filename=z2  count=10000  first=2000  last=4000
elapsed: 4618 ms
rc: 1496797816

erics-mac-mini:reference eric$ ./a.out z3 100000 20000 40000
filename=z3  count=100000  first=20000  last=40000
elapsed: 46668 ms
rc: 1738801584
</pre>

<p>And for wasmtime:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:sqlite3 eric$ wasmtime --dir=. sqlite3.wasm -- w1 1000 200 400
filename=w1  count=1000  first=200  last=400
elapsed: 534 ms
rc: 18766700

erics-mac-mini:sqlite3 eric$ wasmtime --dir=. sqlite3.wasm -- w2 10000 2000 4000
filename=w2  count=10000  first=2000  last=4000
elapsed: 5292 ms
rc: 1496797816

erics-mac-mini:sqlite3 eric$ wasmtime --dir=. sqlite3.wasm -- w3 100000 20000 40000
filename=w3  count=100000  first=20000  last=40000
elapsed: 53024 ms
rc: 1738801584
</pre>

<p>And for wasm2cil:</p>

<pre class="screen">
erics-mac-mini:tool eric$ dotnet run -- run ../sqlite3/sqlite3.wasm -- c1 1000 200 400
filename=c1  count=1000  first=200  last=400
elapsed: 1860 ms
rc: 18766700

erics-mac-mini:tool eric$ dotnet run -- run ../sqlite3/sqlite3.wasm -- c2 10000 2000 4000
filename=c2  count=10000  first=2000  last=4000
elapsed: 5411 ms
rc: 1496797816

erics-mac-mini:tool eric$ dotnet run -- run ../sqlite3/sqlite3.wasm -- c3 100000 20000 40000
filename=c3  count=100000  first=20000  last=40000
elapsed: 42700 ms
rc: 1738801584
</pre>

<p>The printed sum result is the same in each case, and the resulting sqlite database files
are byte-for-byte identical within each run.</p>

<p>To summarize the results, as elapsed time for each run, in milliseconds:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">

<tr align="center">
    <th>Implementation</th>
    <th>1,000 rows</th>
    <th>10,000 rows</th>
    <th>100,000 rows</th>
    </tr>

<tr align="right">
    <td>native</td>
    <td>472</td>
    <td>4,618</td>
    <td>46,668</td>
    </tr>

<tr align="right">
    <td>wasmtime</td>
    <td>534</td>
    <td>5,292</td>
    <td>53,024</td>
    </tr>

<tr align="right">
    <td>wasm2cil</td>
    <td>1,860</td>
    <td>5,411</td>
    <td>42,700</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Weird.</p>

<p>The results for wasmtime are consistently about 13% higher
than native, which is pretty impressive I think.</p>

<p>But the results for wasm2cil are all over the place:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At 1,000 rows, a LOT slower, 394 % of native</p></li>
<li><p>At 10,000 rows, a little slower, 117 % of native</p></li>
<li><p>At 100,000 rows, a little FASTER, 91 % of native</p></li> 
</ul>

<p>It seems bizarre for wasm2cil to be faster than the native code for ANY test,
so for now I'm going to assume this is a defect in my approach.  I did
repeat the runs and got similar results each time.  So this is an
interesting mystery.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>There is no bottom line.  Not yet.</p>

<p>Well actually, I consider it good news that these test runs work (without
crashing or incorrect results), and that timing comparisons are
decent (in the same order of magnitude as native).</p>

<p>Beyond that level of precision, I consider this data interesting as long as I'm not 
drawing big-picture conclusions from it.  These results raise more questions than they answer.  
Mostly I can use the information to guide my efforts to improve wasm2cil.</p>
