title: Absurd Customer Service

<p>I want to share two stories of customer service I have
received in the past week.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >In the first story, I was a customer of Citibank, one of
     the largest banks in the world.</li>
 <li >In the second story, I was a customer of Animal
     Outfitters, one of the smallest retail stores in the world.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wait, let me guess...</h3>

<p>OK, fine.&nbsp; You already know how this is going to turn out.&nbsp;
The huge company was awful and the tiny company was extraordinary.&nbsp; Feel free
to skip the rest of this article if you like, but before you go, I want to leave
you with one thought:&nbsp; </p>

<p>We are all conditioned to expect terrible customer service
from large companies and great customer service from little companies.&nbsp; Yet, those
little companies are the dying breed in the world today.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Isn't that kind of sad?</p>

<p>Right.&nbsp; Off you go.</p>

<h3>Citibank</h3>

<p>So I sat down at my home computer to pay my credit card.</p>

<p>The story goes downhill fast, but I'll admit that it all
started out as my fault.&nbsp; You see, I was late paying this bill.</p>

<p>Sometime recently Citibank changed the way late payments are
made on their website.&nbsp; If you're paying on time, you go through the normal
forms.&nbsp; But if you're paying late, you get sent over to a completely different
section of the website.&nbsp; There, they ask you questions.</p>

<p>Lots of questions.</p>

<p>The first one was "Why are you paying late?"&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the only way to respond to this question is a drop-down list with around a
dozen predefined answers.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I scanned the list for one that said "I just
forgot".&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Not there.</p>

<p>So I looked at every item on the list to see if any of them
applied to my situation.&nbsp; Nope.</p>

<p>It's a mandatory field.&nbsp; I have to give them an answer.&nbsp;
More to the point, I have to give them an answer which is incorrect.</p>

<p>I chose "Natural Disaster".</p>

<p>The rest of the questions were similar:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >When do you expect to resume a normal payment schedule?</li>
 <li >When you resume your normal payment schedule, what source
     of funds will you be using to make the payments?</li>
 <li >What kind of useless crap did you spend your money on
     instead of making your credit card payment on time?&nbsp; (OK, this question
     wasn't really there.&nbsp; I made it up.)</li>
</ul>

<p>My annoyance grew steadily.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that my answer
to every question was just as honest and helpful as my answer to that first
one.</p>

<p>Finally, the Citibank website allowed me to pay my bill.&nbsp;
The whole process was simply <b>absurd</b>.</p>

<p>After the payment succeeded, I immediately called their 800
number and canceled the card.&nbsp; That didn't go very well either.</p>

<h3>Animal Outfitters</h3>

<p>So we got a new dog.</p>

<p>(BTW, thanks to the many folks who sent kind notes back in
March when <a href="/entries/Goodbye_Sadie.html">Sadie</a> was
killed.&nbsp; I did not respond to any of them, but the sentiments were much
appreciated.)</p>

<p>Our new family pet is a white German Shepherd.&nbsp; After some
advice from the rescue and a bit of research, we decided to feed Sophie a
specialty food called Evo.&nbsp; The only store in our area which sells Evo is a
very small place called Animal Outfitters.&nbsp; The owner's name is Mark Fisher.</p>

<p>German Shepherds eat a remarkable amount of food.&nbsp; Monday I
went in to Mark's store for another bag of Evo, but he was sold out.&nbsp; There had
been some sort of delivery problem with his supplier.</p>

<p>As I said, this is a really small store.&nbsp; Usually when I go
in there, the person working is Mark himself.&nbsp; In this case, he went way above
and beyond the call of duty.&nbsp; The next day, he brought in a bag of Evo from
home, the one he had for his own dog.&nbsp; He measured out enough Evo to feed
Sophie until next week when his delivery is supposed to arrive.</p>

<p>And despite my attempts to pay him, he didn't charge me a
dime.</p>

<p>For Mark to give me this dog food was simply <b>absurd</b>.&nbsp;
Fair price for that quantity was perhaps 10 or 15 bucks.&nbsp; I expected to pay.&nbsp;
Heck, I would have paid twice the fair price just out of respect for the law of
supply and demand.</p>

<p>I walked out of the store stunned.</p>

<h3>Absurdity</h3>

<p>In the last week, two companies made an impression on me
with customer service incidents that I will probably remember for years:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I cannot imagine <i>ever</i> having another credit card
     with Citibank.</li>
 <li >I cannot imagine <i>ever</i> buying pet food anywhere but
     Animal Outfitters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both businesses were simply absurd.&nbsp; One in a bad way, and
one in a good way.</p>

<p>The Animal Outfitters store is around 10 years old.&nbsp; When I
first walked in there, I wondered how this guy could possibly stay in business
for so long.&nbsp; Now I know.</p>

<p>And as a fellow entrepreneur, I understand what he did.&nbsp; I
love it when I get a chance to help a customer in a way that makes a big
impression.</p>

<p>But opportunities to be absurd don't come along every day.&nbsp; Whether
it's dog food or software, we need to keep our eyes open and be willing to grab
these situations when they become available.</p>

<p>If we encounter a guy with a problem at just the right
moment and solve it in a highly memorable way, we can sell him high-priced dog
food for decades.</p>

<p></p>
