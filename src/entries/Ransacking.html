<p>In our living room, there is a nativity scene where all the
characters are "stuffed animals".</p>

<p>And every night, the cat pillages it.</p>

<p>The holiday season is supposed to be a time for families to
make memories together.&nbsp; When <i>my</i> kids are grown, they'll remember waking
up every December morning and finding the murdered corpse of a six inch
shepherd by the piano.</p>

<p>At first we weren't sure which cat was the guilty party, but
then one day we saw one of them running through the house with a wise man in
his jaws.</p>

<p>Last weekend I caught the little lech pawing at the virgin
Mary.&nbsp; When I scolded him, he stopped what he was doing and sat down
comfortably in front of the manger, as if he were trying to pretend like he was
part of the scene.&nbsp; He held the pose very well, but he didn't seem to realize
that his relative size was all wrong.&nbsp; I've seen all kinds of animals in
nativity scenes, but never a brontosaurus.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning we found the little stuffed Christ child
left for dead.&nbsp; I confronted the sacrilegious feline about his crime but he
denied any wrongdoing.&nbsp; Hopefully my regular readers know that I respect the
spiritual beliefs of others and I virtually never discuss religion here on my
blog.&nbsp; Still, I like to think that when considering the opportunity to take a
baby Jesus doll behind the couch and throw it a beating, most people would consider
the idea to be "unnecessary" if not "downright risky".</p>

<p>I'm just hoping that if the cat gets scorched by a bolt of
lightning we don't end up with burn marks on the carpet.</p>
