<p>Whenever I explain database sync for mobile, somebody asks,
"What kinds of apps would benefit from that?"</p>

<p>The correct answer is:  "ALL apps".</p>

<p>Actually, that's an exaggeration.  I see no reason for my alarm clock or
calculator apps to sync data with a server.  Let me rephrase:

<p style='text-align:center'><b>Sync
    is the best architecture<br/>for apps where a
database and a server are involved</b>.</p>

<h3>CRUD over REST is an Anti-Pattern</h3>

<p>Many apps today keep the data only on the server and access it using REST.
This approach has some big negative consequences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>

    <p><b>Performance</b>:  Your app is less responsive.</p>

    <p>A round-trip from a mobile device to a server takes a LONG time.  Under
    good network conditions, it could be a quarter of a second.  That's enough time for the
    user to perceive a lag.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the round-trip will take longer, more like a full second, or more.
    That's an eternity, a one-star review in the App Store.</p>

    <p>Numerous studies show that when it comes to the responsiveness of a
    user interface, fractions of a second matter a LOT.  And people don't
    necessarily complain about your app.  They just stop
    using it.</p>

    <p>If you're going to make a round-trip to the server in response to a user
    action, your app is going to feel sluggish.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p><b>Reliability</b>:  Your app doesn't work offline.</p>

    <p>WiFi is great, but not everything is a coffee shop.</p>

    <p>Cellular data networks have dead spots, sometimes in surprising places. 
    Even in areas with solid 3G or LTE coverage, the latency varies wildly.</p>

    <p>If your app is going to stop working when the wireless network is
    unavailable or unreliable, then your app is going to stop working a lot.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p><b>Complexity</b>:  Your app's code has to deal with networking issues everywhere.</p>

    <p>People wrap their REST calls in pretty wrappers to make them look like networking is not involved.
    But it is.
    A robust app needs to deal with all the things that can go wrong.</p>

    <p>If you're going to do all your basic database operations over a REST API,
    all your code is networking code.</p>

    </li>
</ul>

<p>The real question is "What kinds of apps would benefit from having user interaction
dependent on a wireless network with inconsistent coverage and random latency spikes?"</p>

<p>Your app does lots of basic database operations which are often referred to as <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
(Create, Read, Update, Delete).  These operations do not want to happen over a
network.  They want to happen in a database which is local, on the mobile device.</p>

<p>And so you need sync.  In the background (so the user doesn't have to wait on it).
With automatic conflict resolution.</p>

<p>And that's hard.</p>

<h3>Solutions that make sync easy</h3>

<p>Do you like SQL?  If so, I invite you to look at <a href="http://zumero.com">Zumero</a>, our database sync platform based on SQLite, the relational database software preinstalled on over a billion mobile devices.</p>

<p>Do you prefer NoSQL?  Then I'm sure our worthy competitors over at Couchbase would be happy for you to look at <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/wiki/Why-Couchbase-Lite%3F">Couchbase Lite</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, keep your CRUD off the Internet.</p>
