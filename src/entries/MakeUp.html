<p>Edison Middle School's production of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Musical">High School Musical</a>
was this weekend, and it went very well.&nbsp; The kids did a great job, and I
really enjoyed being in the show.</p>

<p>But I'm <i>so</i> glad it's over.&nbsp; Last week was difficult,
and not just because a young boy from the audience came up to me and said, "The
guy who played Coach Bolton in the movie was a <i>lot</i> younger than you!"</p>

<p>No, the most difficult part is that I spent several evenings
last week wearing makeup.</p>

<p>This wasn't a big surprise.&nbsp; I did theater stuff in high
school, so I know that on stage, everybody wears makeup, guys and gals both.</p>

<p>But for this show, a lot of weird stuff kept happening:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >One morning I found lavender panties stuck in the leg of my
     jeans.&nbsp; After years of being the only male in my household, the first
     seriously distressing laundry incident happens during the week I'm wearing
     rouge on my cheeks.&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; I don't think so.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >One evening on the way home from rehearsal I found myself
     singing along with the radio to Shania Twain's &quot;Man! I Feel Like A
     Woman!&quot;&nbsp; I just can't believe this would have happened if I weren't
     wearing lipstick at the time.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Last week when everybody was linking to <a
     href="http://bookblog.net/gender/genie.php">Gender Genie</a>, I gave it a
     try. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it reported that three of my recent posts were
     written by a female.&nbsp; I'm convinced that somehow Gender Genie knew that I
     was wearing eyeliner.</li>
</ul>

<p>So my goal this week is to focus on my own recovery.&nbsp; My plans
include healthy doses of Van Halen and ZZ Top, plus several movies featuring Steven
Seagal, Jet Li and Chuck Norris.&nbsp; And I'm gonna spend lots of time in my woodshop
using loud power tools.</p>

<p>I expect to be feeling much better by the weekend.</p>
