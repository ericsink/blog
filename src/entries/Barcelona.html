<p>Greetings from Barcelona!&nbsp; SourceGear is here as an
exhibitor at TechEd this week.&nbsp; I'm struggling with jet lag right now, but the
coffee is strong and I can see the Mediterranean Sea out my hotel window.&nbsp; Life
is pretty good.</p>

<p>In nearly ten years of business, this is our first trade
show outside the US.&nbsp; We are very accustomed to apologizing for the fact that
our product is English-only, but this week we can offer that apology <i>in
person</i>.</p>

<p>Anyway, we chose this event to start talking about a new
product, SourceGear Fortress.&nbsp; In a nutshell, Fortress is an ALM solution
designed specifically for small and medium-sized teams.&nbsp; I posted an overview
whitepaper in a separate <a href="/entries/SourceGear_Fortress.html">entry</a>.&nbsp;
The product is tentatively scheduled for release in March, but we're giving
preview demos of Fortress in our booth this week.</p>

<p>In fact, I am typing this blog entry from our booth, which
also happens to have a view of the Mediterranean Sea.&nbsp; At this point, I'm
thinking we need to come to this event again in the future.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p></p>
