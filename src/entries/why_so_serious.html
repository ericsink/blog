<p>On the product side of marketing, planning has served me
well.</p>

<p>But on the marcomm side, you know, I just ... do ... things.</p>

<p>And since the whole point of marcomm is to draw attention, I
try to do things which are at least a little outrageous:</p>

<p>We did those things because nobody had done them before.&nbsp; I'll
try just about anything.&nbsp; I just want to see what works.&nbsp; And afterward, I
usually report here on my blog about how these things go.</p>

<p>In the second half of 2009, we did a marketing campaign for
Vault.</p>

<h2>This is your brain on SourceSafe</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, Vault was originally positioned to be
a compelling replacement for SourceSafe.&nbsp; Since our 5.0 release contains a new <a
href="http://sourcegear.com/fortress/video/handoff.html">Handoff</a> feature
which makes it easier than ever to make the transition, we decided to focus
this campaign on the product's original positioning, as a SourceSafe
replacement.</p>

<p>The creative on this campaign was ... edgy.&nbsp; In a nutshell, we
compared SourceSafe to an addiction.&nbsp; The ads were loosely patterned after billboards
and ads aimed at convincing people not to use illegal drugs.&nbsp; The basic idea
was to portray SourceSafe as something which might send your life into a
downward spiral toward a 12-Step program or rehab.</p>

<p>We knew from the beginning that some people were going to be
ticked off.&nbsp; We just weren't sure how many people and who.</p>

<p>We tried testing the ads by taking them home to our spouses
for feedback.&nbsp; This resulted in a few tweaks, but we didn't get any criticism
that caused us to change course.&nbsp; One guy's wife suggested that the ads would
be a better reflection of our industry if the models in the stock photos were
less attractive.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>So we moved ahead.&nbsp; The first thing we did was run the ads
in MSDN magazine, which is published by an outside firm in close coordination
with Microsoft.&nbsp; Nobody complained, so we kept going.&nbsp; We ran banner ads on
several Microsoft-centric websites.</p>

<p><img width=288 height=482 src="/scm/1774_image008.jpg"
align=right hspace=12>And then we showed up in November at the Microsoft
Professional Developers Conference with this campaign as the theme for the
entire booth.&nbsp; We gave away hundreds of T-shirts saying "VSS Must Die".</p>

<p>You can see the whole thing at <a
href="http://vssisdead.com/">vssisdead.com</a></p>

<p>This campaign was darker and more negative than anything
we've done before.&nbsp; We knew we were pushing the envelope.</p>

<h2>Did we go too far?</h2>

<p>Well, we certainly didn't expect to win any Most Admired
Company awards by running a marketing campaign which portrays the users of our
competitor's product as drug addicts.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; But the campaign was intended to be
funny, in a &quot;humor noir&quot; sort of way.</p>

<p>Somewhere during the execution of this campaign, I realized
that SourceSafe is very much like that dorky kid in high school that gets
teased by everybody.</p>

<p>Why do high schoolers pick on other kids?&nbsp; Because it
works.&nbsp; In high school, popularity is correlated with several factors, but one
of them is unkindness.&nbsp; The meaner you are (to the right people), the more
popular you are.&nbsp; Once the crowd has observed who is getting bullied by the
popular kids, others join in.&nbsp; Even if they don't know the kid, they start ripping
on them, just to try and identify with the &quot;in&quot; crowd.</p>

<p>As grownups, most of us know that this is reprehensible.&nbsp; No
kid deserves to be treated this way just because they're different.</p>

<p>But teenagers do it anyway.&nbsp; And they do it because it gets
them what they want.</p>

<p>This particular kid is an easy target.&nbsp; SourceSafe isn't
just a little bit dorky.&nbsp; We're talking pocket protector, greasy hair, and a
sport coat with elbow patches.</p>

<p>When it comes to poking fun, if any company is fair game,
it's Microsoft.&nbsp; And if any Microsoft product is safe to pick on, it's gotta be
SourceSafe.&nbsp; SourceSafe is the bullying target that <a
href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000660.html">everyone</a> can <a
href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/windev/sourcesafe.html">agree</a> on.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=533 height=333 src="/scm/1774_image009.jpg"></p>

<p>Dissing SourceSafe is so common that folks do it whether
they have used SourceSafe or not.&nbsp; Just like in high school, people join the
bashing just because they think it makes them look cool.</p>

<p>And SourceSafe has basically nobody defending it.&nbsp; When
emacs people get an attitude, the vi fans speak up.&nbsp; When Visual Studio fans
start trash talking, the Eclipse crowd starts showing features.&nbsp; But nobody
stands up for SourceSafe.&nbsp; People bash it, and SourceSafe just mopes down the
hall wearing flood pants and a shirt with the top button done.</p>

<p>So anyway, we chose to go negative on this, but we figured we
were in plenty of company.</p>

<p>And while I'm rationalizing and making lame excuses for
being a jerk, please note that SourceSafe is NOT REALLY A PERSON.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>In general, this campaign worked.&nbsp; People at PDC loved the
T-shirts.&nbsp; The click-through rate on the banner ads was the highest we have
ever seen.</p>

<p>Some people were offended, but we received far more positive
feedback than negative.</p>

<p>However, just like the awkward kid at school, SourceSafe
doesn't really deserve this.&nbsp; I've admitted it before, and I'll do it again now:&nbsp;
SourceSafe isn't really that bad.</p>

<p>In its day, SourceSafe was awesome.&nbsp; When it was created by
One Tree in the early 90s, it was nearly revolutionary.&nbsp; SourceSafe brought
ease of use in version control to a whole new level.&nbsp; Microsoft acquired this
product because it was outstanding.</p>

<p>Over the years, SourceSafe hasn't always aged well.&nbsp; Its
architecture didn't fit with the Internet.&nbsp; By relying on file sharing
protocols for network access, SourceSafe ended up with data corruption problems
that triggered a tidal wave of criticism.</p>

<p>But overall, SourceSafe has been a very successful piece of
software.&nbsp; Most of us would love to create something that has thousands of
happy users 15 years later.</p>

<p>At trade shows, people come up to us and ask why they should
switch from SourceSafe to Vault.&nbsp; We always respond by asking them if they are
happy with SourceSafe.&nbsp; If they say yes, we tell them not to switch.&nbsp; This conversation
has happened at every show I have ever attended.&nbsp; Lots of people use SourceSafe
every day without problems.</p>

<p>And despite those negative ads, I believe SourceGear is
doing more for SourceSafe users than any other company, including Microsoft.&nbsp;
We recently shipped <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite 5.0</a>,
a major upgrade with improved performance, new features, and a fancy new ribbon
UI.</p>

<h2>Eric, if this is an apology, it sucks.</h2>

<p>It's not.&nbsp; I don't owe SourceSafe an apology.&nbsp; SourceSafe
isn't a person.&nbsp; It's just a bunch of code.</p>

<p>And it's hard to imagine the need to apologize to Microsoft
as a company when so many of its employees stopped by the booth at PDC to join
the bashing.&nbsp; Some of them took shirts.</p>

<p>So I'm not really apologizing.&nbsp; I'm just sharing about my
experience and my reactions to it.</p>

<p>One exception:&nbsp; SourceSafe's principal author was Brian
Harry.&nbsp; In working through the Microsoft acquisition of Teamprise I came to
know Brian and developed a great deal of admiration for him.&nbsp; He is incredibly
smart, and his accomplishments are amazing, including SourceSafe, the CLR, and
Team Foundation Server.&nbsp; Brian, if our campaign caused you any personal
offense, please accept my public apology.</p>

<p>So anyway, there you have it.&nbsp; I went negative.&nbsp; And it
worked.</p>

<p>I'm not eager to do it again.</p>

<p>But I have no regrets.&nbsp; You know, I just ... do ... things.</p>

<h2>Credit and blame</h2>

<p>I wrote most of this piece in the first person, but the
truth is I deserve more blame than credit.&nbsp; If you were offended or
disappointed by this marketing campaign, blame me.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you
liked this marketing campaign, credit John Woolley and Paul Roub.&nbsp; The creative
work here was mostly theirs.</p>
