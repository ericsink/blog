<p>I am back home from last week's trip to SD West.&nbsp; This might
have been the best trade show trip we've ever done.&nbsp; We had heavy booth traffic
every day.</p>

<h3>T-Shirts and Prizes</h3>

<p>I normally dislike gimmicks like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swag">SWAG</a> or prize drawings.&nbsp; They tend
to attract people who aren't really interested in the company or its products,
causing me to wonder which is worse:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Someone who asks for a T-shirt and is obviously not
     interested in the product.</li>
 <li >Someone who fakes an interest in the product so they can
     feel less guilty about asking for a T-shirt.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nonetheless, despite my usual aversion to booth giveaways,
we distributed around 800 Evil Mastermind T-shirts last week.&nbsp; Wearing one of
those shirts was a prerequisite for entry into the drawings for our bigger
prizes, which included two Wiis, an Xbox 360, and a complete set of Calvin and
Hobbes books.&nbsp; The goal of this whole thing was to get people to wear our
shirts around the show, and it worked.</p>

<h3>Lesson Learned:&nbsp; Get more Smalls and Mediums</h3>

<p>After reading Kathy Sierra's <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/tech_tshirts_ar.html">blog
entry</a> about T-shirts, I wanted to be sure we had the right size shirt for
everybody.&nbsp; We brought every size from Small to XXXL.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we didn't
get the distribution of sizes quite right.&nbsp; Here are the percentages we used:</p>

<table class=MsoTableGrid border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0
 style='border-collapse:collapse;border:none'>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'>

  <p>35%</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-top:none;
  padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'>
  <p>XXL</p>
  </td>
  <td valign=top style='border-top:none;border-left:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;
  border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'>
  <p>14%</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-top:none;
  padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'>
  <p>XXXL</p>
  </td>
  <td valign=top style='border-top:none;border-left:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;
  border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'>
  <p>5%</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>This wasn't a horrible guess, and might have been just right
if the event were in, say, Wisconsin.&nbsp; But out there in Silicon Valley where
everybody is thin and beautiful, we ran out of Small and Medium shirts toward
the end of the show.&nbsp; Also, we expected XL to be a little more popular than L,
but we probably should have ordered equal amounts of each.</p>

<p>In our next order, we'll shift the distribution a bit toward
the smaller sizes.</p>

<h3>How to get an Evil Mastermind shirt</h3>

<p>I've had quite a few people asking how they can get one of
these shirts without going to SD West.</p>

<p>You can't "buy" these shirts with money, but the shirts are nonetheless
not completely free.&nbsp; The people at SD West received a shirt and paid for it by
wearing it around the conference.&nbsp; You can receive a shirt if you agree to
provide "payment" using the following method:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Take a picture of yourself wearing the shirt.&nbsp; For an
     example of the proper pose for the photo, follow the excellent example set
     by <a
     href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/03/19/46507.aspx">Craig
     Andera</a>.</li>
 <li >Post the photo on your blog, including a link back here to
     my blog.&nbsp; Or post the photo on Flickr.</li>
 <li >Send us email with a link to your photo, granting us
     permission to use the picture in say, a <a
     href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomosaic">photo mosaic</a>.&nbsp; <b>;-)</b></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently this is the only form of payment we can accept for
an Evil Mastermind shirt.</p>

<p>If you want one of these shirts according to the terms
above, send an email to <a href="mailto:evil-mastermind-shirt@sourcegear.com">evil-mastermind-shirt@sourcegear.com</a>
with your shipping address and preferred shirt size (yes, we've got Small and
Medium available now).</p>

<p><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>While supplies last.&nbsp; Offer
limited to the United States and Canada.&nbsp; Offer void where prohibited, taxed or
restricted.&nbsp; No purchase necessary.&nbsp; Shown with optional equipment.&nbsp; Financing
requires credit approval.&nbsp; Not all buyers will qualify.&nbsp; Allow 4-6 weeks for
delivery.</span></p>

<h3>Real Booth Traffic</h3>

<p>Without a doubt, the T-shirts and cool prizes attracted lots
of people who were mostly just interested in the free stuff.&nbsp; However, we still
talked to more genuine prospects than any show I can remember.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >This was not a Windows-centric conference.&nbsp; We wanted to
     let people know that in version 4.0 Vault is becoming a cross-platform
     product, so we had a Mac in the booth running Eclipse with our source
     control plugin.&nbsp; This was very well received.</li>
 <li >Reaction to Fortress was very positive.&nbsp; I can't wait
     until we get this product shipped.&nbsp; For now, if you want to see our
     preview release, <a
     href="http://www.sourcegear.com/fortress/downloads.html">give it a try</a>
     and <a href="http://support.sourcegear.com/viewforum.php?f=30">let us know</a>
     what you think.&nbsp; Fair warning:&nbsp; This thing is still quite unpolished.&nbsp;
     It's not ready for production use yet.</li>
 <li >In addition to Fortress, we took the opportunity to show a
     preview of DiffMerge 3.0.&nbsp; This is a full-featured file-level diff and
     merge tool, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.&nbsp; A <a
     href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html">preview release</a>
     is available now.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my first time at SD West, and I'm really glad we
went.&nbsp; I always perceived this show as a great place to be for a company
selling source control tools, as long as those tools are not Windows-only.&nbsp; I
was glad to see 7 version control vendors on the expo floor (AccuRev,
Microsoft, Perforce, Seapine, SourceForge, SourceGear , and Telelogic).</p>

<h3>The Jolt Awards</h3>

<p>My book didn't do so well at the Jolt Awards, but the
quality of my competition was exceedingly high.&nbsp; The main winner in my category
was</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><i><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321482751/sawdust08-20">Agile
     Software Development</a></i> by Alistair Cockburn.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the Jolt winner, they recognize 3 more
entries in each category with a "Productivity Award" (which is basically an
alternate spelling for "Honorable Mention").&nbsp; The Productivity Award winners
were:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><em><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321336623/sawdust08-20"><span
     style='font-style:normal'>Catastrophe Disentanglement</span></a></em> by
     E. M. Bennatan</li>
 <li ><em><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/097451408X/sawdust08-20"><span
     style='font-style:normal'>Practices of an Agile Developer</span></a></em>
     by V. Subramaniam and A. Hunt</li>
 <li ><em><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735605351/sawdust08-20"><span
     style='font-style:normal'>Software Estimation Demystifying the Black Art</span></a></em>
     by Steve McConnell</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, since there were 7 finalists in this category,
there were three other books comprising the "non-winners":</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><i><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596234/sawdust08-20">Eric
     Sink on the Business of Software</a></i> by Eric Sink</li>
 <li ><i><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0977213315/sawdust08-20">Software
     Creativity 2.0</a></i> by Robert L. Glass</li>
 <li ><i><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/093263365X/sawdust08-20">Weinberg
     on Writing: The Fieldstone Method</a></i> by Gerald M. Weinberg</li>
</ul>

<p>I would love to have won, but I remind myself it was an
honor to be among the finalists at all.&nbsp; So, and with a nod toward one of my
favorite quotes from the Simpsons:</p>

<p>In one sense, we're all winners, but in another far more
accurate sense, Alistair Cockburn is the winner.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
