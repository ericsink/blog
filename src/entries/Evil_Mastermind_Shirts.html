hspace=12>T-Shirts and Wii Systems at Tech-Ed</h3>

<p>Next week at Tech-Ed we will be handing out T-shirts just as
we did at <a href="/entries/sdwest_trip_report.html">SD West</a>.&nbsp;
The deal is the same as last time:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Free shirt for anybody who visits our booth (while supplies
     last)</li>
 <li >Sizes from S through XXXL</li>
 <li >Wearing the shirt makes you eligible to get a ticket to
     one of our four Wii prize drawings.<br>
     <span style='font-size:8.0pt'>(Must be present to win.&nbsp; Must be wearing an
     Evil Mastermind T-shirt.&nbsp; SourceGear employees not eligible.)</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>The "Other" Way get an Evil Mastermind shirt</h3>

<p>For those of you not attending Tech-Ed, my previous shirt
offer is still available:</p>

<p>You can't "buy" these shirts with money, but the shirts are
nonetheless not completely free.&nbsp; The people at the trade show receive a shirt
and pay for it by wearing it around the conference.&nbsp; You can receive a shirt if
you agree to provide "payment" using the following method:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Take a picture of yourself wearing the shirt.&nbsp; For an
     example of the proper pose for the photo, follow the excellent example set
     by <a
     href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/03/19/46507.aspx">Craig
     Andera</a>.</li>
 <li >If you have a blog, post the photo there, including a link
     back here to my blog.</li>
 <li >Send us email with the photo (or a link to your photo on
     your blog), granting us permission to use the picture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently this is the only form of payment we can accept for
an Evil Mastermind shirt.</p>

<p>If you want one of these shirts according to the terms
above, send an email to <a href="mailto:evil-mastermind-shirt@sourcegear.com">evil-mastermind-shirt@sourcegear.com</a>
with your shipping address and preferred shirt size.</p>

<p><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>While supplies last.&nbsp; Offer
limited to the United States and Canada.&nbsp; Offer void where prohibited, taxed or
restricted.&nbsp; No purchase necessary.&nbsp; Shown with optional equipment.&nbsp;
Financing requires credit approval.&nbsp; Not all buyers will qualify.&nbsp; Allow 4-6
weeks for delivery.</span></p>

<h3>Pictures from Previous Shirt Recipients</h3>

<p>We've sent out quite a few of these shirts already, and the
pictures are starting to roll in.&nbsp; Paul has set up a <a
href="http://people.sourcegear.com/~proub/suboptshirts/">photo album</a> to
collect them together for all to see.&nbsp; Some of the photos are quite ... creative.&nbsp;
<b>:-)</b></p>

<p>The current award for the most disturbing photo goes to <a
href="http://blog.debreuil.com/archive/2007/05/07/5029.aspx">Robin Debreuil</a>
for this clever piece of Photoshop work:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=386 height=570 src="/scm/1673_image002.jpg"></p>

<p>Perhaps I should not be surprised, but every time I see this
picture, I just can't believe he did it.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
