title: On Git's lack of respect for immutability and the Best Practices for a DVCS

<p>I learned something very important from the feedback after
my entry last week on <a href="/entries/git_index.html">Git's
index</a>.&nbsp; Here's what I learned:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Suppose I wrote a 300 page book
describing all the great things about Git and why it is so awesome.&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Further suppose that on page 295
near the bottom, I include a one-sentence mention of a way that I think Git
might change for the better.&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Further suppose that I wrote that
sentence in Klingon.&nbsp; And then I encrypted it with Schneier's latest cipher,
wrapped it in base64 encoding, ran it through rot13 and then pasted it into the
book.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>If I did this, the primary response
from the Git user community would be:&nbsp; "Eric's new book says that Git sucks.&nbsp;
He doesn't get it."</p>

<p>Trust me folks -- I get it. &nbsp;Commits to a DVCS are
different.&nbsp; When you commit to a private instance of the repository, you don't
"break the build".&nbsp; The rules and guidelines for a DVCS are different than the
ones for a centralized system.</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

<p>But some of the best practices are the same.&nbsp; Here's my
off-the-cuff sloppy definition of a "best practice":&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>A best practice is a guideline that
can be followed lots of times by lots of different people in lots of different
situations with minimal likelihood of causing pain to the team.</p>

<p>Actually, I want to give TWO definitions.&nbsp; Here's another
one, speaking as a source control vendor:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>A best practice is a guideline that
I can give to our customers to minimize the likelihood that they will need to
call our tech support staff.</p>

<p>A technique can be "really cool" or "very powerful" and
still not qualify for any reasonable person's definition of "best practice".</p>

<p>I stand by my original claims.&nbsp; I think "git add --p" is
"really cool", but it doesn't qualify as a "best practice".&nbsp; It allows the developer
to commit code they have never seen.&nbsp; Yes, that commit happens in a private
instance of the repo, but that code is eligible to be pushed into another
instance.</p>

<h3>Is there a good outcome here?</h3>

<p>Suppose I use "git add --p" to commit some code that doesn't
even compile.&nbsp; What can happen?</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Maybe this changeset never escapes my private repository
     instance.&nbsp; In that case, it has caused no harm.&nbsp; But it has also caused no
     benefit.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Maybe my next checkin fixes the build.&nbsp; So now the
     offending changeset is less likely to cause problems, because the fix will
     get pushed as well.&nbsp; But this scenario is equivalent to the centralized
     case where I break the build but fix it before anybody finds out.&nbsp; It's
     not very harmful, but it's not very helpful either.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Maybe I later use Git's history rewriting features to
     eliminate the offending changeset, replacing a chain of small changesets
     with one larger one that has been well-tested.&nbsp; In this scenario, I have
     eliminated all the potentially harmful effects, since the DAG will not
     have any nodes that are "broken".&nbsp; But now I have other concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Immutability</h3>

<p>The issue of rewriting history is perhaps my biggest
philosophical objection to the way Git works.&nbsp; Call me old fashioned if you
like, but I believe changesets and the history of the repository should be
immutable.&nbsp; Version control features that alter history make me squirm.</p>

<p>My own <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">product</a>
supports an "Obliterate" feature and I hate it.&nbsp; I understand why it's there,
but I still wish it wasn't.&nbsp; One thing I've learned from twelve years of
supporting version control products is that customers will find a way to misuse
things.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The purpose of Obliterate is to help with that once-a-year
situation where you really screwed up and checked in something that should
never have been in the repository and absolutely must be removed.&nbsp; But every
now and then we get a tech support call from somebody who is using Obliterate <i>every
day</i>.&nbsp; Those are the days when I want to ship the product with that feature
locked and only enable it for customers where every developer has passed a
written exam.</p>

<p>Think about it.&nbsp; Even if you love Git's ability to rewrite
history, does this <i>sound</i> to you like a "best practice"?&nbsp; Or does it
sound like a quick way to get a bunch of geeks addicted to recreational
pharmaceuticals?</p>

<h3>Sandboxes</h3>

<p>Like I said, I get it.&nbsp; A DVCS gives me a private sandbox,
so I can have more freedom while I play.&nbsp; It's "really cool" that I can kick
and throw sand without hurting the other kids.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean it's a
"best practice".</p>

<p>Conceptually, my private instance of the repository is still
part of a larger whole.&nbsp; The entire repository may not exist on any one
machine, but it exists in concept.&nbsp; It is one big Directed Acyclic Graph.&nbsp; When
I use "git add --p" and checkin something that doesn't compile, my offending
commit is conceptually still a member of that DAG.</p>

<p>The best practices for a DVCS are built around this
principle:&nbsp; The extra freedom provided by a private sandbox should be held in
the proper tension with a measure of respect for the entire DAG.</p>

<p></p>
