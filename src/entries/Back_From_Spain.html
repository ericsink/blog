<p>I got back last night from Spain.&nbsp; I brought my family with
me to Tech-Ed Barcelona and we stayed an extra week for vacation.</p>

<p>A few notes from the trip, some of them business-related,
others from the family vacation:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >As a trade show, Tech-Ed was okay.&nbsp; I overheard some of
     the other vendors describing it as a big waste of time.&nbsp; I won't say it
     was a good show, but I don't think it was <i>that</i> bad.&nbsp; To be fair,
     I'll admit that we intentionally kept our expectations low.</li>
 <li >This was our first trade show outside the US.&nbsp; The first thing we noticed is that the booths are weird.&nbsp; In every previous trade
     show, the setup had been the same:&nbsp; We get a piece of floor space,
     approximately 10 feet square, with a curtain hanging in the back and a
     shorter curtain between us and our next door neighbors.&nbsp; At Tech-Ed
     Europe, each booth is a box, bounded on two sides by a wall.&nbsp; The booths
     are grouped four together in a square, so every space is a corner booth.&nbsp; I
     got the impression that this is just the way shows in Europe are done.</li>
 <li >I chatted with Miguel de Icaza for a while, catching up a
     bit.&nbsp; It sounds like it might be time for us to take another look at the
     Mono Windows Forms stuff.</li>
 <li >Barcelona is an amazing city.&nbsp; I wish we had stayed there
     longer, but I did get to see a few things:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li >There's a cathedral that has been under construction for
      200 years.&nbsp; They say it's almost done now.&nbsp; Another 20 years or so and it
      will be ready for use.&nbsp; There are so many jokes to make about this that
      I'm not even going to pick one.</li>
  <li >In the old part of town, we went into another cathedral.&nbsp;
      Fantastic.&nbsp; Those European cathedrals are just amazing, and there's
      nothing really like them here in the states.</li>
  <li >We toured the Picasso art museum.&nbsp; Did you know Picasso
      did "normal" paintings for years before he started doing all that weirdo
      stuff?&nbsp; I had no idea.</li>
 </ul>
 <li >I was quite surprised at the amount of Spanish in Barcelona.&nbsp; Basically, this city speaks Catalan, which is a funky mixture of Castilian Spanish
     and French.&nbsp; I speak very rusty quasi-fluent Spanish which I learned 15
     years ago when we lived in Spain.&nbsp; I expected to have problems in Barcelona, but I didn't.&nbsp; Everybody speaks Castilian Spanish.&nbsp; Also, it turns out that in
     its written form, Catalan is closer to Spanish than I thought.&nbsp; To me,
     Catalan looks like Spanish with everything spelled wrong.</li>
 <li >Before the kids came along, Lisa and I lived for a year or
     so in Torrejón de Ardoz, a town just outside of Madrid.&nbsp; So after the
     conference was done, we got on a train from Barcelona to Madrid and spent
     the second week based in Torrejón.</li>
 <li >Torrejón has changed a lot in 15 years.&nbsp; Before leaving Barcelona, we took the kids to McDonalds and told them that it was their last American
     food for a while, since Torrejón is a much smaller town and has no fast
     food places.&nbsp; When we got to our hotel in Torrejón, there was a McDonalds
     directly across the street.</li>
 <li >Torrejón has a town plaza.&nbsp; In the corner of that plaza is
     a church.&nbsp; That church has a tower.&nbsp; On the roof of that tower is an
     enormous bird nest, perhaps 4 or 5 feet in diameter.&nbsp; I'm no expert on
     birds, but they look like storks.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm pretty sure that nest has
     been there for at least 15 years.&nbsp; I remember seeing it before.</li>
 <li >I picked up some souvenirs on the trip.&nbsp; One of my
     personal traditions is that I always carry a wallet which was purchased
     during one of my foreign trips.&nbsp; My current billfold is wearing out, so I
     picked up a new one.&nbsp; Spain is a pretty good place to buy leather stuff.</li>
 <li >My most notable souvenir is a Spanish guitar.&nbsp; Thursday
     night I went to Madrid planning to buy a classical guitar at a big music
     store near the Palacio Real.&nbsp; Instead, I ended up at a place called <a
     href="http://www.condehermanos.com/index.htm">Conde Hermanos</a>, one block
     away.&nbsp; I ended up spending a lot more than I planned, but I sort of fell
     in love with this quaint little luthier shop.&nbsp; They sell guitars that are
     hand-made right there in the store.&nbsp; The wall is covered with photographs
     of famous classical and Flamenco guitarists proudly holding their Conde
     Hermanos guitar.&nbsp; So anyway, I bought a guitar, and I shook hands with the
     guy who made it.&nbsp; The whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.</li>
 <li >For you guitar freaks out there, my little collection of
     acoustic guitars now includes:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li >A Conde Hermanos Flamenco guitar.&nbsp; Cypress.&nbsp; Hand-made in
      Madrid and purchased there.</li>
  <li >A Martin HD-28. &nbsp;Indian Rosewood.&nbsp; This guitar may be the
      sweetest sounding of the bunch.</li>
  <li >A Larrivee Parlor Guitar.&nbsp; Mahogany.&nbsp; Nice for travel.&nbsp;
      Sounds great for its size.</li>
  <li >A Taylor 614C.&nbsp; Maple.&nbsp; Very bright sound.</li>
  <li >A 1968 Martin D-35S.&nbsp; Brazilian Rosewood.&nbsp; This is my
      "birth year" guitar.&nbsp; From the serial number, I estimate it was made just
      a couple weeks before I was born.</li>
 </ul>
 <li >Madrid has grown a lot.&nbsp; I don't remember the subway
     trains being so crowded before.&nbsp; Our friends there told us that around 2
     million immigrants have moved into Spain over the last several years.&nbsp; For
     a country with a population of around 40 million, that's a pretty
     significant change.</li>
 <li >The best day trip from Madrid is El Escorial.&nbsp; The
     monastery there is really amazing.&nbsp; The train ride is approximately an
     hour.&nbsp; When you get off at the train station, there will be a bus to take
     you up the hill to the monastery.&nbsp; Don't take the bus.&nbsp; Instead, walk up
     the hill, through the park.&nbsp; It's a little more than a mile, and the grade
     makes it kind of a workout, but it's an extremely pleasant walk.</li>
 <li >One of my favorite sights in Spain is the Roman aqueduct
     in Segovia.&nbsp; It was built around the end of the first.&nbsp; I just find it
     amazing that this enormous structure, built from granite blocks with no
     mortar or concrete, has been standing there for almost 2,000 years.</li>
 <li >By the end of our second week, my Spanish was starting to
     come back.&nbsp; I'm still very rusty, but I can carry on a conversation if the
     other parties will be somewhat patient with me.</li>
 <li >I ran out of reading materials on the trip, so I bought a
     Spanish translation of one of the Harry Potter books.&nbsp; It was rather slow
     reading for me, but I got through it all.&nbsp; I found it terribly unfortunate
     that the clever wording of "Diagon Alley" just doesn't work in Spanish.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, right now I'm glad that the westbound jet lag isn't
nearly as bad as the eastbound version of the disease.&nbsp; This is a short work
week because of the Thanksgiving holiday, and I'm still catching up from all
the email and other stuff that I missed.</p>
