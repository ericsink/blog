<p>I have added an EPUB file to the <a
href="/vcbe/index.html">Version Control by Example</a>
homepage.&nbsp; This e-book format seems to accommodate most readers except the
Kindle.</p>

<p>In general, this book doesn't translate to e-book formats nearly
as well as a novel. Throughout the book, I used a lot of illustrations, source
code listings, and color.&nbsp; If the rendering of these things on my iPad is
typical, then I would say that they made the journey to EPUB in acceptable but
not perfect condition.</p>

<p>But for now I cannot say the same thing about the Kindle.&nbsp;
My initial attempts to create a Kindle version have been incredibly
disappointing.&nbsp; The resulting e-book just looks awful.&nbsp; If and when I come up
with a Kindle version that looks decent, I will make it available.</p>
