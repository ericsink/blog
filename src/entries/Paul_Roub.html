<p>Seven weeks ago I <a
href="/entries/Apprentice.html">announced</a> a job opening
in product marketing here at SourceGear.&nbsp; Today I am pleased to say that we
have filled that position.</p>

<p>This was one of the most difficult hiring decisions I have
ever made.&nbsp; That job posting generated a <i>lot</i> of responses.&nbsp; I can't
remember when we've seen so many strong and qualified applicants for a job.</p>

<p>In the end, we hired <a href="http://roub.net/">Paul Roub</a>.&nbsp;
Paul and his family will be moving to Champaign this summer from Florida.</p>

<p>Interesting tidbits:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >If you clicked on the link just now, you learned that Paul
     is a rather accomplished <a
     href="http://paulroub.com/images/fltoday-article-2006-12-08.png">musician</a>.&nbsp;
     I'm hoping I get a chance to hear him play the Taylor 615 I see in his
     pictures.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Paul is also the author of an open source project called <a
     href="http://ieview.mozdev.org/">IE View</a>, which is "a simple Mozilla
     and Mozilla Firefox extension (for Microsoft Windows systems), which
     allows the current page or a selected link to be opened in Internet
     Explorer".<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Professionally, Paul's background has all the right stuff
     we were looking for.&nbsp; He is as fanatical as we are about the tools that
     teams use (version control, bug tracking, builds, etc).&nbsp; He's a .NET guy
     who also has lots of experience with Java as well as lower level stuff. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted to hire someone who was fully qualified to be a
development lead, but with strong interest and aptitude for marketing.&nbsp; I think
we found the right person.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>If you'd like to meet our new marketing hire, stop by the
SourceGear booth at Tech-Ed in Orlando, June 4-7.</p>

<p>Paul, welcome aboard!</p>

<p></p>
