<p>The latest element of our Evil Mastermind advertising
campaign is a Flash banner ad which is currently running over at <a
href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/">DotNetJunkies</a>.&nbsp; It should appear at
the top of the page, but our ad is just one of several in a rotation, so you
may have to hit reload a few times to see it.&nbsp; Or, spare the DotNetJunkies
people the extra server load and go see the ad <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/ads/FlashBanner.html">on our website</a>.</p>

<p>I have a serious question about this ad, but you need to see
it first.&nbsp; So go watch it now.</p>

<p>And if you haven't read our full-length <a
href="/entries/Comics_at_TechEd.html">comic book</a>, you need to
at least skim it.&nbsp; Come back here when you're done.&nbsp; I'll wait.</p>

<h3>Done?</h3>

<p>Good.&nbsp; Now I have a question to ask, but I'm having trouble
figuring out to phrase it.&nbsp; Try this:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Did we go too far?</p>

<p>Wait, that question isn't specific enough.&nbsp; Try this:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>How do you feel about the way the
female characters are portrayed in our comics?</p>

<p>Prior to the full-length comic book, I believe we were
completely above reproach.&nbsp; The only women in our comic were minions (the minions
are the smart people).&nbsp; All the minions dress the same, in T-shirts and jeans, regardless
of their gender.</p>

<p>But the full length comic book is a little bit edgier:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >On the first page there is a character named London
     Hampton.&nbsp; She's a spoiled celebrity heiress to a billionaire hotel
     fortune.&nbsp; She's fully dressed, but her clothes are not exactly modest.</li>
 <li >Later in the story we introduce a character named Ada
     Deadlock.&nbsp; Ada is an outside consultant brought in as a project manager to
     keep the minions in line.&nbsp; She is a female counterpart to the Evil
     Mastermind.&nbsp; Once again, she is fully dressed, but her closet is
     apparently devoid of anything with a high neckline.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two characters have raised a few eyebrows.&nbsp; Not
everyone approves.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Our industry isn't exactly gender-balanced.&nbsp; I still
remember the year that <a href="http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/">Julie Lerman</a>
scanned the Tech-Ed speaker list and noticed that the female speakers were
outnumbered by the speakers named Brian.&nbsp; I don't want our company to be
contributing to the problem.</p>

<p>I have two daughters.&nbsp; I bristle a bit when I think about
the subtle ways that the world may be steering them away from certain kinds of
opportunities.</p>

<p>So I get annoyed when I flip open a magazine and see a
software company using provocative pictures of women in their ad.&nbsp; If you're
advertising a grid control or a reporting tool, show me the product, not the
model you hired.</p>

<h3>Back to my question</h3>

<p>Anyway, I'm hearing people complain about our comic in
exactly the same way that I complain about booth babes at trade shows.&nbsp; Have I
become a hypocrite?&nbsp; I hope not.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't think SourceGear has crossed the line.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >We're dealing with female characters as part of a story,
     not a product ad with a completely gratuitous photo.</li>
 <li >Our stuff is extremely tame in contrast with what is typical
     of the comic genre today.</li>
 <li >I'll admit that London Hampton is cut from an unfortunate
     stereotype, but we're poking fun at a specific real-world celebrity who is
     apparently cut from that same unfortunate stereotype.</li>
 <li >Ada Deadlock is drawn as an attractive woman, but she is
     also smart and powerful.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm pleading "not guilty", but I still consider this
issue to be important.&nbsp; I'd be interested in the opinions of my readers on this
matter.&nbsp; Am I wrong?&nbsp; Did we go too far?&nbsp; Feel free to post a comment here or
send me an email.</p>
