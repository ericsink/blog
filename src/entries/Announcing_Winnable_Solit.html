<p>It's time to unveil a pet project of mine:&nbsp; <a href="http://solitaire.ericsink.com/">Winnable Solitaire</a></p>
<p>This game is very much like the Solitaire program that comes with Windows, with one major difference:&nbsp; Every game is winnable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price is $12.&nbsp; A free demo download is available.&nbsp; I expect that the app will work on most Windows PCs.</p>
<p>I am anticipating that some folks will want to know WHY I would do something like this.&nbsp; You'll have to wait for my next MSDN column to get the answer to that question.&nbsp; For now, I will say this:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Winnable Solitaire is a pet project of mine, not a SourceGear product.&nbsp; I developed it for fun, and for the purpose of writing some articles about it.&nbsp; Yes, it is a real product, and yes, I am charging real money for it.&nbsp; However, I remain fully, 100% committed to my current job at SourceGear.&nbsp; This is not a job change for me, nor is it a change in direction for SourceGear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the story will [hopefully] make sense when my next MSDN article gets published.&nbsp; I have submitted the article to the editors.&nbsp; It is scheduled for publication in early September.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you get bored and need something to do, I recommend playing a few games of solitaire.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
