title: Software Developer opening at SourceGear

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; This position has been <a href="/entries/03may2005.html">filled</a>.</p>
<p>If we can find just the right person, we would very much like to add a Software Developer to our core team here at SourceGear.&nbsp; Are you "just the right person"?&nbsp; If you are, then you fit the following description:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>You have <em>deep</em> expertise with development using Microsoft SQL Server.&nbsp; You know how to use triggers and indices and foreign keys and inner joins and stored procs and views and all that other SQL crapola that I've never understood and don't care to.&nbsp; Most importantly, you know to make these things run FAST.</p>
<p>You have experience with C, C++, C# or Java.</p>
<p>You have experience using a source control tool.</p>
<p>You have a bachelor's degree in computer science from a good university.</p>
<p>You are smart.</p>
<p>You have excellent written and spoken English.</p>
<p>You are willing to live in Champaign, Illinois.&nbsp; (To be a part of our core team, you have to be <em>here</em>.&nbsp; No telecommuting.)</p>
<p>You are a <a href="/No_Programmers.html">developer</a>, not a <a href="/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">programmer</a>.</p>
<p>You know how to read code, not just write code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SourceGear was founded in 1997.&nbsp; The company is owned by three partners (Corey Steffen, Dan Schreiber, and myself).&nbsp; All three of us have a technical background and are involved in the business full-time, managing the company with a style we think is both visionary and conservative.&nbsp; The company is profitable and growing.</p>
<p>Salary for this position will be commensurate with experience.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we pay better than anybody else in the Champaign area, but don't expect us to match the salary from your San Francisco dot-com job back in 1999.&nbsp; Our benefits package is typical of small companies like ours and includes health insurance and 401K.</p>
<p>Every employee has good equipment and a private office with a door that closes.&nbsp; We eat lunch together on Wednesdays, paid for by the company.&nbsp; The fridge has free soft drinks, which most people here call "<a href="http://www.popvssoda.com/">pop</a>".
</p>
<p>I think Champaign is a nice place to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an eclectic area, built around a <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">major university</a> which is sitting in the middle of a large farming region.&nbsp; You can buy a four-bedroom house for $175K.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure the world's largest ball of string is around here somewhere, although I've never actually seen it.&nbsp; The ocean is only 16 hours away by car.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>SourceGear LLC supports workplace diversity and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender, or any of the other things people should not use for discrimination.&nbsp; On the other hand, we <em>do</em> discriminate against fussy prima donnas and people who don't finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corey and I would really like to discriminate against anyone who is not an Illini fan, but Dan is an Indiana grad so we never seem to reach consensus on that issue.</p>
