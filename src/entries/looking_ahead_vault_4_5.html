<p>I consider Joel Spolsky to be my friend and teacher, but frankly I'm getting sick of his elitist New York attitude.&nbsp; A couple of days ago, he posted yet another <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/07/18.html">blurb</a> on his blog about how "interesting" life is in New York compared to the Midwest.&nbsp; Rubbish.</p>
<p>First of all, if you want to pick on a region for being boring, it seems like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Mike Gunderloy</a>&nbsp;would be an easier target.&nbsp; Mike is one of my favorite writers, but good grief!&nbsp; Out there in the eastern part of Washington state, he's a long way from anything we would describe as civilization.&nbsp;
At his latitude, Gunderloy probably has the only copy of Visual Studio between Redmond and Minneapolis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Champaign is completely different.&nbsp; Stuff here is happening.&nbsp; It was only a few months ago that they upgraded the intersection near my home with a stop sign.&nbsp; And just in time too!&nbsp; Yesterday, for the first time ever, I saw <em>three</em> cars meet there at the same time.</p>
<p>Not impressed?&nbsp; Okay Joel, top this:&nbsp; When was the last time you folks in Manhattan had a serial killer who eats all his victims?</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, there have been <em>four</em> mysterious disappearances in the neighborhood where I live, just a few miles north of Champaign.&nbsp; Nobody has actually witnessed these crimes, but we found a half-eaten carcass from one of the victims, and it seems quite obvious what is going on.&nbsp; Everybody knows there is a coyote den nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coyotes may be stupid, but they are apparently smart enough to realize that our neighborhood is serving up a buffet of feline entrees.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this string of tragedies has struck my own home.&nbsp; Recently, we let our cat out for an evening jaunt and she never returned.&nbsp; In all seriousness, this loss has hit my family hard.&nbsp; Lilac wasn't some nameless farm cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a blue point Siamese and we got her as a kitten during our first year of marriage, over 16 years ago.&nbsp; She had become part of the family.&nbsp; In fact, I am quite certain my wife liked Lilac more than she likes me.&nbsp; (And can you blame her?&nbsp; Compared to me, the cat did approximately the same amount of housework and was a much better listener.)</p>
<p>Anyway, life here in central Illinois is too interesting for my tastes.&nbsp; I don't have time for all this.&nbsp; It takes a significant amount of energy for me to keep up the proper "guy" image and pretend like I don't miss the cat.&nbsp; To make matters worse, there's no "coyote season" in Illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not actually legal to kill a coyote, which means I have to invest all kinds of extra time and planning to make it look like an accident.</p>
<p>I wish I had founded SourceGear in Manhattan where life is simpler and I wouldn't be so distracted with all this stuff.&nbsp; What I really need to be doing is focusing on my new job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yep, I've got a new set of responsibilities here at SourceGear.&nbsp; This week I traded hats with Dan (one of my business partners) and became the project manager for Vault.</p>
<p>I guess I'm just a nerd, because I think this is going to be fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aforementioned snooty New Yorker says that good software takes <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html">ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vault is currently in year four, one of my favorite phases in the life of a software product.&nbsp; We just finished version 3.1.&nbsp; Our product is starting to get really <em>good</em>.&nbsp; Now it's time to make our product <em>great</em>.</p>
<p>We're talking now about our next two major releases.&nbsp; Vault 4.0 is probably going to consist primarily of features requested by our customers.&nbsp; Right now I'm just trying to finalize the spec and schedule and figure out who is going to do what.</p>
<p>Vault 5.0 is being envisioned as more of a strategic release, with several major features that are specifically intended to support our longer-term direction for the product.&nbsp; We're working on this release now as well, developing parts of it in parallel with 4.0.</p>
<p>Since our plans aren't really firmed up yet, I'm not going to give any other details right now, but I plan to be blogging about Vault development along the way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I keep thinking I might draw some inspiration for "my other project" by watching a few old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote">cartoons</a>.&nbsp; <strong>;-)</strong></p>
