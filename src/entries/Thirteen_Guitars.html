<p>The connotation of the term "Web 2.0" is that the Web is a
piece of software in its second major version.&nbsp; The term implies that there was
a version 1.0 and that there will probably be a version 3.0.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So I find myself wanting to ask the kind of questions I
normally ask when I see a software product at version 2.0:&nbsp; </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >What is the feature set of the current version?&nbsp; </li>
 <li >What are its known bugs?&nbsp; </li>
 <li >What can I expect from the next version?</li>
 <li >When will the next version be available?</li>
</ul>

<p>I could certainly respond to these questions by writing
about some of the very positive things I see on the Web today.&nbsp; The Web is
incredible!&nbsp; Remember back when the "What's New" page at NCSA was a listing of
basically every site on the Web?&nbsp; We've come a long way.&nbsp; There are some
amazing things happening in this version of the Web.</p>

<p>But right now I'm in a "glass half empty" sort of mood.&nbsp;
When I look at the state of the Web today, one big thing jumps out at me:&nbsp; The
defining characteristic of this version of the Web is the people who are ruining
it.</p>

<p>This past weekend I was bidding on a guitar on eBay.&nbsp;
Shortly before the auction ended, I received email from the seller offering to
end the auction early.&nbsp; Believing that the seller was trying to do something
unethical, I stopped bidding and somebody else won.&nbsp; Only later did I realize
that the email was actually sent by someone impersonating the seller.&nbsp; The
auction was apparently legit.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Shortly after the auction ended, I received a "Second
Chance" offer from the seller.&nbsp; This time I was more discerning of the fraud.&nbsp;
Like the first one, this email was not really from the seller.</p>

<p>And then I received two more of these Second Chance offers.</p>

<p>And then in morning I got three more.</p>

<p>At last count, I have received email from 13 different
people offering to sell me the guitar I did not win.&nbsp; The laughable part of
this story is that the manufacturer only made 12 of this particular model.&nbsp;
There are exactly 12 of these guitars on the planet and I've got 13 people
offering to sell me one!&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>I didn't actually give money to any of the 13 crooks who
tried to cheat me.&nbsp; I'm not really upset about losing the auction.&nbsp; What
distresses me here is that these 13 people won, and the rest of us lost:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I lost the chance to buy the guitar I wanted.&nbsp; [footnote
     1]</li>
 <li >The seller lost money.&nbsp; I don't know if I would have won
     the auction or not, but the seller would have received a higher price than
     he did.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >eBay lost credibility.&nbsp; Every time fraud shows up in the proximity
     of an eBay auction, eBay's reputation takes another hit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know I'm not the first one to be shocked and frustrated
about the presence of evil in the world.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just shouting at the rain,
but sometimes a little shouting feels good, especially when this is just the
tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; There are <i>many</i> examples of fraud or vandalism on
the Web today.&nbsp; Here are just a few other obvious examples:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >For Google's advertising business, click fraud is out of
     control.&nbsp; [footnote 2]</li>
 <li >For individual computers, viruses are out of control.&nbsp;
     [footnote 3]</li>
 <li >For email, spam is out of control.&nbsp; [footnote 4]</li>
</ol>

<p>I could go on with more examples, but you get the idea.&nbsp; The
Web today is enormous.&nbsp; It is used by hundreds of millions of people, perhaps
billions.&nbsp; A small percentage of those people are causing a lot of damage.</p>

<p>I feel sad.</p>

<p>It seems like the current version of the Web has a flaw.&nbsp; In
the real world, it is always easier to destroy than to build, but this
disparity seems to be magnified on the Web.&nbsp; People who are actively working to
make the Web a better place are climbing uphill pulling a heavy trailer.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the spammers and fraudsters are coasting in their convertible with
the top down.&nbsp; I hope the next version of the Web has some improvements in this
area.</p>

<p>However, I don't have any solutions to offer right now.&nbsp; I'm
just having one of those moments where a realization is hitting me hard:&nbsp; These
"evildoers" are becoming the primary influencers of my experience on the Web
today.&nbsp; [footnote 5]</p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[1]&nbsp; Yes, the auction was
partly my fault.&nbsp; If I were more experienced with eBay, I would have been less
gullible and would have continued bidding.&nbsp; Next time, I will know better, but
that's still a workaround for the real bug.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[2]&nbsp; I've read so many
stories about click fraud lately that I don't know which one to link.&nbsp; More and
more, I hear people saying that they no longer run their AdWords on the content
network.&nbsp; We don't.&nbsp; The content clicks were a major fraction of our AdWords
spending, and we were getting no measurable value from them.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[3]&nbsp; Yes, viruses pre-date
the Web, but the Web has given them a more effective delivery vehicle.&nbsp; BTW,
three weeks ago I had to repave my machine because of a virus.&nbsp; The Windows
Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) offered to remove the virus, and I said
yes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, its concept of removing the virus is simply to remove all
the files which are infected.&nbsp; The MSRT could have saved me a lot of time by
simply popping up a dialog box that said, "Your system is irretrievably fouled
up.&nbsp; Get some coffee, back up your files, and reformat the hard disk."</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[4]&nbsp; The guy who administers
our network at SourceGear told me recently that less than five percent of the
mail we receive is legitimate.&nbsp; BTW, I think we need to stop saying that the
spammers only continue because they make money doing it.&nbsp; Virus writers don't
make money.&nbsp; They write viruses simply for the joy of causing harm to others.&nbsp;
I don't see much reason to believe that spam would stop if the financial
incentive were magically removed somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[5]&nbsp; And who are these
evildoers anyway?&nbsp; Considering the enormous impact they have on the Web today,
it seems wrong for them to be so invisible.&nbsp; Why aren't they blogging?</span></p>
