title: Welcoming Dropbox Datastore

<p>So I guess maybe I need to stop telling people that <a href="http://zumero.com">Zumero</a> is "like Dropbox,
except for data instead of files".  <b><tt>:-)</tt></b></p>

<p>This week, Dropbox announced their 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/43/the-datastore-api-a-new-way-to-store-and-sync-app-data">Datastore API</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, the Datastore API only supports single-user scenarios, but on the Dropbox
forums, some "Dropboxer" named "Steve M." clearly 
<a href="https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=102820">says</a> that
multi-user is in their plans.  I don't know who Steve is, but I consider this
kind of remark in a developer forum to be more authoritative than a press
release.  So I'm going to skip the blog article where
I say that "Datastore is nothing more than a cross-platform iCloud" and
start considering Dropbox to be a Zumero competitor immediately.</p>

<p>And I'm going to cautiously say that this is a good thing.</p>

<p>Well fine.  I'll admit that this news is not <i>all</i> good.  Those of you
who have been reading my stuff for a
long time might recall a <a href="/Choose_Your_Competition.html">piece I wrote ten years ago</a> 
where I said the ideal
competition is "big and dumb".  As far as I can tell, Dropbox doesn't really
fit into that quadrant.  They seem pretty smart.  And even though they are FAR
bigger than
Zumero (how many <i>private</i> companies have done a 100M acquisition anyway?), 
they're still pretty small (221 employees, 257M funding, 
<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/dropbox">according to Crunchbase</a>).  
So if I were to choose a competitor, I'd prefer somebody bigger and dumber than
Dropbox.</p>

<p>Still, this news is <i>mostly</i> good.  Why?  Because (1) now we have a
category, and (2) Zumero's differentiation is solid.</p>

<h3>Category</h3>

<p>Mobile data sync has been in a weird place.  Some people see Zumero and say,
"OMG this is so cool and it's exactly what I needed and how does it work?".
Other folks send us notes and say, "Why would anybody want this?  Everybody has
completely reliable LTE, right?"</p>

<p>Anecdotally, the need for sync in mobile is quite clear.  One example:  StackMob (one of
those cool Backend-as-a-Service companies) 
<a href="https://blog.stackmob.com/2013/05/stackmob-introduces-smarter-offline-sync/">says</a>,
"The ability for apps to work offline is the most requested feature we see from
developers."</p>

<p>I've been doing my part to evangelize the cause, such as I did in my
previous blog entry, 
<a href="/entries/crud.html">Keep your CRUD off the Internet</a>.  
But nobody listens to me.</p>

<p>Oh, sorry, dear reader.  I didn't mean to imply that <i>you</i> are a
nobody.  I appreciate you.  Really, I do.</p>

<p>A bigger voice for the cause is Couchbase co-founder Chris Anderson, who
tends to run around claiming that 
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jchris/sync-is-the-future-of-mobile-data">Sync is the Future of Mobile Data</a>.  
(Godspeed, Chris.)</p>

<p>But all this localized noise isn't the same as having a widely understood
category.  A category gives people a label which can be used to very quickly
(and with some inaccuracy) explain what a product is.  When somebody says, "It's a
first-person shooter", you know immediately what to expect.  You know
that it will be somewhat like Doom (if you're my age) or Halo (if you think
Michael Jackson was always white).  And if by
chance you are not familiar with the label, you can expect to Google
it and get it explained quickly.  You know that Wikipedia will have an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">overview</a>, 
and probably a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first-person_shooters">list</a>.</p>

<p>Products without a category are incredibly hard to sell.  Most of them fail
or stay confined to a small niche.  Two of my favorite examples of this point are Segway and Hypercard.
Both were far more successful than the
average product without a category.  And yet, they both faced challenges
arising from the absence of a widely-understood label.  In both cases, what
I remember most is all the people asking, "What is it?"</p>

<p>With the Dropbox announcement this week, mobile data sync took a big step
toward becoming a category.  Previously, it was basically just Couchbase and
Zumero.  And we don't have our series A yet.  And our closest airport uses
regional jets.  So we don't count.  Which means actually it was just Couchbase.
I don't know what the official criteria are for the existence of a category,
but having only one "funded company near a real airport" is not enough.</p>

<p>Now we have two.  Couchbase and Dropbox.  (Plus that little company
out in the Illinois cornfield, the one that starts with a Z.)</p>

<p>Do I really want these two companies as my competition?  No, but
Zumero is probably not big enough to get a category started, and
Couchbase and Dropbox probably are.  And we <i>must</i> have a category.
Having competition is rarely fatal.  Selling without a category usually is.</p>

<p>Shout out to Forrester analyst <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Michael-Facemire">Michael Facemire</a>:
Hello Michael, what's happening? Ummm, I'm gonna need you to go ahead and begin
writing about this mobile database sync category. So if you could start
drafting some research about Couchbase Lite and Dropbox Datastore, that would
be great, mmkay.. oh oh! and I almost forgot ahh, I'm also gonna need you to go
ahead and mention Zumero in there too, kay. We ahh have a great product, but
we're two hours from Chicago, and ah, we sorta need to play catch up.</p>

<h3>Differentiation</h3>

<p>There is no reason to be scared of competition if your differentiation is
solid.  For most people, this rule is extremely counterintuitive.  They see
competition and they run away.  They think the only way to be successful is to have
a product that is better.</p>

<p>That thinking is correct but incomplete.  Actually, you need to have a product
which is better <i>for some [sufficiently large] group of customers</i>.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with the word "better".  Being better is good.  Making your
product better is good.  Three cheers for "better".</p>

<p>But I have found that it is often more productive to think less about how your
product can be better and think more about how your product can be
<i>different</i>.</p>

<p>The word "better" connotes a simple two-person race or game.  Run faster.
Hit harder.  It encourages an inward focus.  It drives attention to the product
and your competitors.  These things aren't all bad.</p>

<p>But the word "different" suggests that you ask for <i>whom</i> your
product will be better.  It drives attention to the customer.  It wants you
to think about a [sufficiently large] group of people whose
different needs lead them to see your product as the best choice.</p>

<p>In marketing terms, this is Ries and Trout Law #2: "If you cannot be first in your
category, setup a new category" 
(which is another thing <a href="/item_10174.html">I wrote about a long time ago</a>).</p>

<p>So I feel great about Zumero because our product is different from Couchbase
and Dropbox in very significant ways, the most important of which is SQL.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in the religous war, so don't email me to explain how Mongo saved your marriage.  NoSQL is cool.  But the simple fact
is that lots of companies have a massive investment in SQL.  And those
companies want mobile solutions which integrate with their existing stuff using
technologies they already know.  There is enormous business opportunity for
us.</p>

<p>Is Zumero <i>always</i> better than Couchbase Lite and Dropbox Datastore?
For every single situation?
Certainly not.  But for companies who prefer SQL, it certainly is.</p>
