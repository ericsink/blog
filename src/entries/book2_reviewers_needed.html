 <li >I've got enough reviewers now.&nbsp; Thanks!</li>
 <li >Due to popular demand and some assistance from the
     reviewers, the book will have more Git coverage than I had expected.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Short summary:</h3>

<p>I've been writing a book about version control.&nbsp; The first
draft is complete, and I need reviewers to help me polish it and make it shiny.&nbsp;
If you'd like to review the book and provide feedback, contact me at <a
href="mailto:eric@sourcegear.com">eric@sourcegear.com</a>.</p>

<h3>More details:</h3>

<p>Back around 2004 I wrote a series of blog entries called <a
href="/scm/source_control.html">Source Control HOWTO</a>.&nbsp;
My original intent was to turn this content into a book.</p>

<p>But I kept getting distracted by something else.&nbsp; As time
passed, the material in the book became rather stale.&nbsp; Those blog entries were
written before DVCS became popular.&nbsp; Everything in the version control world is
different now.&nbsp; Eventually I realized that if I wanted to write a book about
version control, I would be starting from scratch.</p>

<p>A few months ago I dropped everything else to focus on
writing.&nbsp; This week I finished my first draft of the content.&nbsp; Now I am looking
for people who would like to review that draft and give me feedback which I can
use to finish polishing it for publication.</p>

<p>Here are some things you need to know:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The title of the book is "Version Control by Example".&nbsp; It
     has 12 chapters and is 216 pages long.</li>
 <li >The emphasis of the book is on DVCS.&nbsp; Subversion gets lots
     of attention, but it is the only non-DVCS which is covered beyond a
     passing mention.&nbsp; Mercurial is also covered in depth, as is Veracity.&nbsp; I
     wish I could have spent a similar number of pages on Git or Bazaar or
     Fossil or Darcs, but my deadline forced me to make choices.</li>
 <li >This book is not flame war material.&nbsp; Long-time readers of
     my blog know that my style is to never hesitate in complimenting my
     competitors when admiration is warranted.&nbsp; I have much respect for
     Subversion and Mercurial, so I chose to spend a lot of time discussing
     them in the book.&nbsp; Bickering about whether Mercurial is better than Git is
     simply not interesting to me, so the book doesn't spend any time on that
     kind of stuff.</li>
 <li >If you like SourceGear Vault, you probably won't like this
     book.&nbsp; My apologies.&nbsp; This particular book is focused on tools which are open
     source and command-line oriented.&nbsp; (Watch for our Vault 6.0 release coming
     out this fall!)</li>
 <li >The book will be available in printed form.&nbsp; I am self
     publishing it, mostly so that the copies I give away will cost me two
     dollars apiece instead of ten.</li>
 <li >All of the content for this book will be published here on
     my blog, including HTML, print-friendly PDF, and screen-friendly PDF.</li>
 <li >The book will be sent off to the printers in about three
     weeks or so.&nbsp; I'll have copies with me at <a
     href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011">OSCON</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So now I am gathering a list of people interested in being
reviewers.&nbsp; If you would like to be on that list, send me an email at <a
href="mailto:eric@sourcegear.com">eric@sourcegear.com</a>.&nbsp; I will be sending
all the reviewers a draft (as a PDF file, roughly 5 MB in size) sometime in the
next week.</p>
