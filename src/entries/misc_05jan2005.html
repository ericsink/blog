<p><strong><font size="4">Version control best practices</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4"></font></strong>For those of you waiting for the next chapter of my Source Control HOWTO, there is good news and bad news:</p>
<ul>
<li>The good news is that I am writing again.&nbsp; I just posted <a href="/scm/scm_history.html">chapter 6</a>, which covers history and labels.
</li>
<li>The bad news is that chapter 6 is not about branching like I planned it would be.&nbsp; I started writing the branching chapter and realized I needed to cover labels and history first.&nbsp; I am once again working on the branching chapter, which should become chapter 7.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="4">Changing everything but his wardrobe...</font></strong></p>
<p>Chapter 6 contains an admittedly gratuitous mention of Tim Krauskopf, founder of Spyglass.&nbsp; Tim is probably the smartest person I have ever known.&nbsp; My brain works reasonably fast, but in every conversation with Tim I am struggling to keep up.&nbsp; I look back at my years at Spyglass and still can't believe I learned so much stuff.&nbsp; Working for "TimK" was the defining experience of my career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim's own career has taken an interesting new direction in the last year or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's gotta be the only person on earth whose typical week involves driving a semi truck, driving a Lamborghini, and hacking C++ to decode GPS data.&nbsp; It was inevitable that someone in the press would eventually tell his story.&nbsp; Earlier this week the Chicago Sun Times <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/tech/cst-fin-truck03.html">finally did</a>.&nbsp; Congratulations Tim!</p><p><strong><font size="4">If you can't say something nasty, then don't say anything at all.</font></strong></p>
<p>The week before Christmas my server machine was "cracked" by Internet vandals somewhere in Brazil.&nbsp; I have tried several times to write about this event, but I can't seem to craft a fitting reaction without using lots and lots of profanities.&nbsp; I don't think I want my weblog to become that kind of place, so it turns out that I have nothing to say.</p>
