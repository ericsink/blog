<p><font size="4"><strong>New browser</strong></font></p>
<p>Several weeks ago I switched to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.&nbsp; The switch was basically painless, just like everybody said it would be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past I have usually preferred to use Internet Explorer, in part because of the role I played in the development of its <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html">ancestors</a>.&nbsp; But my time as a browser hacker was a long time ago, and I am more pragmatic now.&nbsp; Firefox is a better browser.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>New mail client</strong></font></p>
<p>My good experience with Firefox prompted me to try <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> as my mail client.&nbsp; I've been using Outlook 2003, but it's awfully slow and I don't use the Calendar/Contacts/Tasks stuff.&nbsp; Part of my motivation for the switch was that I wanted to switch from POP to IMAP, and anecdotal evidence suggests that Outlook's IMAP support is really lame.</p>
<p>This transition has been a bit more painful than the change of browser.&nbsp; I am now using Thunderbird for both email and RSS, but it's far from perfect.&nbsp; I miss Outlook's virtual folders.&nbsp; I miss having Lookout for really fast searching.&nbsp; I miss NewsGator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have yet to decide if I will switch back.&nbsp; Even if I do, I think I'll stay an IMAP user.&nbsp; I like running the spam filter on the server side instead of the client.&nbsp; I get at least several hundred spams per day.&nbsp; With IMAP, I don't have to download them to my desktop machine.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Doom 3</font></strong></p>
<p>I'm not a serious gamer, but I recently decided to give Doom 3 a try.&nbsp; Very cool, but it's amazing how hungry this game is for good video hardware.&nbsp; I've tried it on the ATI Radeon 9800 and the nVidia 6800 GT, both with 256 MB.&nbsp; (There is no comparison at all -- the nVidia is <em>way</em> better.)</p>
<p>By the way, now I can say that I know at least one person whose computer has less RAM than my video card, so I advance to the next level of <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Geek_Gauntlets.html">geekiness</a>.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">New RDs</font></strong></p>
<p>Congratulations to the new Microsoft Regional Directors, including a couple of guys I know because their companies are Vault users: &nbsp;<a href="http://aspsoft.blogs.com/">Jonathan Goodyear</a> (of <a href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">ASPSOFT</a>) and <a href="http://www.scottwater.com/">Scott Watermasysk</a> (of <a href="http://telligentsystems.com/">Telligent Systems</a>).&nbsp; It is gratifying to see that both of these firms seem to be doing really well right now.</p>
<p>And my condolences to Jonathan on the recent <a href="http://aspsoft.blogs.com/jon/2004/09/days_of_blunder.html">damage</a> to his <a href="http://www.aspsoft.com/images/porsche/PorscheFront.jpg">Porsche</a>.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">WTF</font></strong>
</p>
<p>I love reading <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a>.&nbsp; I don't usually link to it, partially because I don't want to be explaining this acronym to my wife, my Mom or my daughters.&nbsp; But Wednesday's entry was on the topic of version control so I just gotta give a <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/archive/2004/09/29/2162.aspx">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Chapter 6</font></strong></p>
<p>I've been working on chapter 6 of my <a href="/scm/source_control.html">Source Control HOWTO</a>, but it's coming slowly.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience.&nbsp; As I move to the more advanced concepts of source control, the writing takes a bit more time than it did on the early chapters.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">The "first day of the month" blues</font></strong></p>
<p>The first day of the month can be a little disconcerting for us here at SourceGear.&nbsp; Our ecommerce system has a feature which tries to predict the total sales for the month using a <em>very</em> simplistic formula:&nbsp; It calculates the average revenue per weekday so far and multiplies that times the number of weekdays in the month.</p>
<p>When I came in to the office this morning around 8:30am, our sales for the day so far were $1,099.&nbsp; So, with 21 weekdays this month, our ecommerce system was predicting total October revenue of around $23,000.&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; Let's just say that this would NOT get the bills paid around here.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>We try not to take this thing too seriously, especially at the beginning of a month.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Photography Rant</strong></font></p>
<p>I am gradually trying to become a "serious amateur" photographer.&nbsp; The path seems like it should be straightforward.&nbsp; A photographer is just a different flavor of geek, substituting glass and light for chips and logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned a lot, but mostly I have learned how hard it can be to get a really good picture.</p>
<p>For the past several weeks, there has been a bird sitting in her nest in a small pine tree adjacent to my driveway.&nbsp; At this very moment, I know that she is there, and the reason I know that she is there is that my camera is not.&nbsp; She dutifully cares for her eggs, 24 hours a day, never leaving her nest except when I am trying to get a picture of her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made several attempts, using various combinations of long lenses, sneakiness, tripods and wireless remotes.&nbsp; To date, I have been thoroughly outsmarted by a creature whose brain is smaller than my CapsLock key.&nbsp; And every day when I get home from work, she is there, MOCKING ME.</p>
<p>I think for now I will confine my photographic pursuits to subjects which are incapable of flight.</p>
<p><em>I tried to sneak this silly tale into my latest MSDN column.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out,&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/"><em>Chris Sells</em></a> <em>actually does read my stuff before he lets it get published.&nbsp; The story didn't belong, so he made me cut it.&nbsp; Yes, I concede that he was right, and I'll also admit that it doesn't really belong here either.&nbsp; :-)</em></p>
