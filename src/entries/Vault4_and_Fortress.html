<p>Wii systems?&nbsp; Comic books?&nbsp; T-shirts?&nbsp; Doesn't SourceGear do
<i>software</i> anymore?</p>

<p>Indeed we do.</p>

<p>As I said on Tuesday, next week at Tech-Ed is going to be
big for SourceGear.&nbsp; I've told you about all sorts of marketing fluff, but the
big news is our product releases.&nbsp; After many months of development, we will be
unveiling version 4.0 of SourceGear Vault and the first public release of
SourceGear Fortress.</p>

<p>I feel more jazzed about these new releases than I have
about any product cycle before.&nbsp; All our marketing efforts would be rather
pointless if they weren't being done in support of some very cool software
products.</p>

<h3><img width=200 height=343 src="/scm/1676_image001.jpg" align=right
hspace=12>Vault 4.0</h3>

<p>Vault 4.0 brings many improvements and new features to our
users, but two big things are worth highlighting:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Dramatically improved integration with Visual Studio 2005.</li>
 <li >Integration with Eclipse, including support for
     non-Windows platforms like Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a longer spiel, see our <a

whitepaper</a> <span style='font-size:9.0pt'>(1.2 MB PDF)</span>.</p>

<h3>Fortress</h3>

<p>Fortress is an integrated solution for application lifecycle
management (ALM):</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Version control (built from the same source tree as Vault
     4.0)</li>
 <li >Work item tracking (from Dragnet, with significant new
     improvements).</li>
 <li >Excellent integration with Visual Studio 2005 and Eclipse.</li>
 <li >Easy to install.&nbsp; Designed specifically for small and
     medium-sized teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're calling this version 1.0 because we see the initial
release of Fortress as the beginning of a journey.&nbsp; Future releases will offer
a more comprehensive feature set for ALM.</p>

<h3>Next Week</h3>

<p>These new products will be released and available for
download and purchase on Monday.&nbsp; Watch for them to appear on the <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear website</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you will be at Tech-Ed, if you want to see what
we <i>really</i> do here at SourceGear, stop by our booth next week for a demo.
&nbsp;And yes, you can have a comic book and a T-shirt too.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
