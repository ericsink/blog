<p>I got several responses to my query about SOAP interop with ASP.NET.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Axis was mentioned several times.&nbsp; Some had good results with it, but not everyone.&nbsp; Two people suggested that Axis does just fine as long as things don't get terribly complicated.
</li>
<li>One person reported good results using SOAP::Lite from Perl.
</li>
<li>One person mentioned gSoap with positive remarks.
</li>
<li>One person reported that they were able to achieve good interop by simply hand-coding their own implementation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>
