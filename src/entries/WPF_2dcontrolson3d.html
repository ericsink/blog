<p>The WPF 3D community has been buzzing this week about
something new that was announced yesterday.&nbsp; Describing the news in advance,
Daniel Lehenbauer <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/archive/2006/12/13/you-do-not-want-to-miss-this.aspx">said</a>,
"something incredibly important is going to be announced tomorrow afternoon"
and "Trust me, you DO NOT want to miss this."&nbsp; In Tim Sneath's preview, he <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/12/12/wpf-in-three-dimensions.aspx">described</a>
it as an "exciting announcement".</p>

<p>So what was the big news?&nbsp; The <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wpf3d/archive/2006/12/12/interacting-with-2d-on-3d-in-wpf.aspx">ability</a>
to interact with a 2D control placed in 3D space.</p>

<p>As you can probably tell, I'm a <i>little</i> underwhelmed.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong -- I agree this is incredibly cool.&nbsp; It
makes a great demo.</p>

<p>But the actual usefulness of this feature is not immediately
obvious to me.&nbsp; Personally, I've never yearned to wrap a combo box around a
sphere.</p>

<p>When I saw the pre-announcement hints, I hoped it would be
something else.&nbsp; Like maybe support for volumetric textures?&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>As it is, this feature reminds me of the time I wrote code
to allow AbiWord to flow text into a circular container.&nbsp; Nifty for demos, but
what am I going to use this for?</p>
