<p>We adopted Sadie from the animal shelter just last summer,
so her time with our family was short.&nbsp; But she was a really sweet dog.&nbsp; We all
miss her terribly.</p>

<p>In the past, I have always identified myself as <i>not</i> a
"dog person".&nbsp; When I was a kid, we had cats.&nbsp; Sadie was the first dog I ever
owned, and her addition to our household came at the conclusion of a long
series of objections from me.&nbsp; Initially, I described Sadie as "my wife's dog"
or "the kids' dog".&nbsp; Over time I was surprised how attached I became.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I am surprised at the amount of grief I am feeling now.</p>

<p>This entry is obviously way off-topic.&nbsp; Why am I posting
this?&nbsp; It has nothing to do with software or business.&nbsp; Certainly there are lots
of more important things happening in the world right now.</p>

<p>I'm posting this entry because it's about me.&nbsp; People often
ask me how similar I am to the character I play here on ericsink.com.&nbsp; I'll
admit that I craft my publicly persona very carefully, but I like to think that
the Eric Sink you see here is a real representation of who I am.</p>

<p>Don't worry -- I'm not going to start posting every little
detail of my life.&nbsp; But this is not a little detail.&nbsp; This feels really big to
me right now.</p>

<p>I lost <i>my </i>dog yesterday.</p>

<p>It hurts.</p>

<p>I could not credibly claim that this blog is really me if I
didn't tell you.</p>
