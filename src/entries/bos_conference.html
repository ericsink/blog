<p>Save the date:</p>

<p>On October 29-30, Neil Davidson of Red Gate is hosting a <a
href="http://www.businessofsoftware.org/">conference</a> on the Business of
Software.</p>

<p>Neil has organized a <i>really</i> impressive speaker list,
and I'm not saying that just because I'm one of them.&nbsp; In fact, I'm saying that
in spite of the fact that I'm one of them.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Oh I almost forgot:&nbsp; If you put yourself on the list of
people interested interest in the conference (no obligation), you'll get a free
copy of my book in "eBook" form.</p>
