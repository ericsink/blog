<p>Warning:&nbsp; Blatant marketing hype ahead.&nbsp; Use Caution.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Below is the text of a marketing whitepaper we are releasing
this week.&nbsp; The PDF version of the whitepaper is <a

<h1>Introducing SourceGear Fortress</h1>

<p><i>The ALM Solution for Professional Development Teams</i></p>

<h2>Development Teams Want Integration</h2>

<p>The world of software development is always changing.&nbsp; We've
come a long way since the days when all we needed was a compiler and a text
editor.&nbsp; Today, there is a vast array of "team tools" available, including
version control software, bug tracking systems, project management software,
automated build tools and automated testing frameworks.</p>

<p>In the last fifteen years, our industry has greatly
increased its use of such tools:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Fifteen years ago, most development teams had little or
     nothing in the way of tools to help them be more effective.&nbsp; Some used
     version control.&nbsp; A few used bug tracking.&nbsp; Very few used automated builds
     or automated testing.</li>
 <li >Ten years ago, version control and bug-tracking had become
     more common, but were still employed by a minority of software teams.</li>
 <li >Five years ago, the use of team tools had increased, but
     in a piecemeal fashion.&nbsp; Developers assembled a complete solution by
     picking and choosing from each category.&nbsp; They would select one vendor for
     version control, a second for bug-tracking, and a third for build
     management.&nbsp; The various tools were generally not integrated.&nbsp; The
     resulting solution was complex and often costly.</li>
 <li >Today, the use of these team tools is more widespread than
     ever, and expectations are rising.&nbsp; Developers, dissatisfied with the
     level of integration across vendors, are searching for a seamless
     solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; They demand the sort of tightly-coupled package that comes
     from a single vendor who will provide excellent customer support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking into the future, we can predict continued adoption
rates and better integration.&nbsp; In five years software teams will expect a
seamlessly integrated solution.&nbsp; Development teams will no longer consider
version control and bug tracking separate products.&nbsp; They will expect a package
that offers both in a seamless and fully integrated fashion.</p>

<h2>Application Lifecycle Management</h2>

<p>Today, the term most closely associated with the concept of
an integrated solution is "Application Lifecycle Management".&nbsp; An increasingly
common substitute for that ten-syllable term is "ALM".</p>

<p>As implied by the word "lifecycle", ALM solutions typically
include tools for every phase of the software development process:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Project management</li>
 <li >Project tracking</li>
 <li >Requirements planning</li>
 <li >Design</li>
 <li >Development</li>
 <li >Testing</li>
 <li >Quality assurance</li>
 <li >Builds</li>
 <li >Release management</li>
</ul>

<p>The leading ALM vendors today include IBM, Borland and
Microsoft.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, their ALM solutions are very focused on
enterprise customers.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; The enterprise ALM market is an attractive
place to do business.&nbsp; When a large enterprise buys an ALM solution, the
transaction can be in the millions of dollars.</p>

<h2>Not Just For The Enterprise</h2>

<p>We use Microsoft's terminology to describe the various tiers
of the software development industry:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The word "Enterprise" refers to a company with at least
     500 developers.</li>
 <li >The word "Professional" refers to a company with less than
     500 developers.&nbsp; Such a company is also referred to as a "small or medium-sized
     business" or "SMB".</li>
</ul>

<p>It is common to see enterprise companies with 5,000 or more
developers.&nbsp; Due primarily to the sheer size of these organizations, enterprise
development teams have special needs.&nbsp; Today's ALM products are specifically
targeted to meet those special needs.</p>

<p>At SourceGear, we believe that large teams are not the only
ones who can benefit from an integrated solution.&nbsp; Small and medium-sized
companies want ALM too, but they want solutions designed for their special
needs.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >They want an ALM tool which is painless.&nbsp; It should be
     easy to install.&nbsp; It should have an intuitive user interface.&nbsp; Its ongoing
     maintenance burden should be minimal.&nbsp; Small and medium-sized businesses
     typically do not have the resources to hire an employee just to baby sit
     the ALM server.</li>
 <li >They want an ALM tool which supports their way of
     working.&nbsp; Enterprise development tends to place a lot of emphasis on
     formal processes, strict policies and documented methodologies.&nbsp; In
     contrast, most small and medium-sized teams find those features too
     heavy-handed.</li>
 <li >They want an ALM tool which is affordable.&nbsp; Its pricing
     should be easy to understand.&nbsp; Purchasing should be straightforward.&nbsp; The
     cost should be compatible with the leaner budgets often found in small and
     medium-sized businesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, professional development teams want ALM solutions
that are different from the enterprise-focused products available today.</p>

<h2>SourceGear Fortress</h2>

<p>SourceGear has been selling developer tools with a special
focus on professional development teams since 1997.&nbsp; Our flagship product,
SourceGear Vault, is extremely popular as a reliable, powerful, and affordable
option for the millions of developers working in small and medium-sized
businesses today.</p>

<p>In 2007, SourceGear will launch an ALM solution especially
designed for those same users.&nbsp; We call it <b>SourceGear Fortress</b>.</p>

<p>Our recipe for building this product begins with the highest
quality ingredients:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >On the server side, we build on the stable technologies
     from our existing products, used by tens of thousands of developers every
     day:</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li >Start with the mature and powerful version control
      features from SourceGear Vault.&nbsp; We have done seven major releases of
      Vault since it was introduced in 2003.&nbsp; Today, Vault has over 25,000
      users all over the world.</li>
  <li >Add the features of SourceGear Dragnet for work item
      tracking and project management.&nbsp; SourceGear customers have been using
      this technology for over six years as we have continually refined its
      features, stability and performance.</li>
  <li >Mix these two technologies together to form a powerful
      and stable server, completely integrated.&nbsp; The Fortress server has one
      installer, one login system, and one place to manage license keys.</li>
 </ol>
 <li >On the client side, we have built entirely new
     applications for the most popular IDEs, presenting the user with a
     seamlessly integrated experience:</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li >Our client for Visual Studio 2005 is a full-featured way
      to access the Fortress server.&nbsp; It provides version control and work item
      tracking functionality inside the Visual Studio environment.</li>
  <li >For Java developers and cross-platform teams, Fortress
      includes an Eclipse plugin, offering the same features and functionality
      as our Visual Studio client.&nbsp; The Eclipse client is supported on Windows,
      Linux, Solaris, and MacOS.</li>
  <li >For developing scripts and custom solutions, Fortress
      includes an easy-to-use client API, accessible from either Java or .NET.</li>
 </ol>
</ol>

<p>The result is an exciting product that we believe many
professional development teams will see as an attractive option.&nbsp; SourceGear
Fortress is an integrated solution, an ALM system designed specifically for the
needs of small and medium-sized development teams.</p>

<h2>Pricing and Release Schedule</h2>

<p>SourceGear Fortress 1.0 is tentatively scheduled for release
in March 2007.&nbsp; Pricing is $499 for developers and $199 for non-developers.&nbsp;
Current customers of SourceGear Vault and Dragnet who want to transition to
Fortress will be offered special pricing.</p>

<p>Those who prefer to stay with Vault need not worry about its
future.&nbsp; Vault is SourceGear's flagship product, and we have big plans for it.&nbsp;
Vault 4.0 is scheduled to be released simultaneously with Fortress 1.0.&nbsp; New
features will include:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >New admin tool, improved user interface</li>
 <li >New Java support and Eclipse integration, offering greatly
     improved support for cross-platform development teams</li>
 <li >New Visual Studio 2005 integration client, greatly
     improved over the MSSCCI-based client</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we have already sketched out our plans for
Vault 5.0, 6.0 and beyond.</p>

<p>Vault 4.0 will continue to support integration with
third-party bug tracking systems such as FogBugz (Fog Creek) and OnTime
(Axosoft).</p>

<p>SourceGear Fortress will not replace Vault.&nbsp; We know many
customers will continue to prefer the simplicity and elegance of our flagship
version control product.&nbsp; Others will need the richer functionality of our
integrated ALM solution.&nbsp; Both groups of customers will continue to receive the
excellent technical support for which our company is known.</p>
