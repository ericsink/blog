<p>Hello world.&nbsp; I've been on vacation for the last week or so.&nbsp; I've got bunches of emails awaiting my response.</p>
<p>Sometime while I was gone, the folks at MSDN published my <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software08052004.asp">latest article</a>.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
<p>By the way, I am now mirroring all my Business of Software articles from MSDN <a href="/bos/Business_of_Software.html">here</a> on my weblog.&nbsp; I'll publish "Product Pricing Primer" there as soon as I get a chance.</p>
