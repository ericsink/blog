title: Windows XP and the importance of listening to customers

<p>On June 30, Microsoft will discontinue Windows XP in an
effort to force all PC users onto Windows Vista.&nbsp; As this date gets closer and
closer, they have stubbornly insisted that they will not change their plans.</p>

<p>Last week, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer <a
href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9927721-7.html?tag=nefd.only">blinked</a>,
but in a rather confusing way:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The sensible part:&nbsp; Ballmer claimed that they might
     reconsider their decision if that's what customers wanted.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >The confusing part:&nbsp; Ballmer appeared to be completely
     ignorant of the multitudes of people publicly begging for XP to get a stay
     of execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just want kind of customer feedback would Ballmer be able to
hear?</p>

<p>It's really not that hard to find overwhelming evidence of
large numbers of people who want to continue using XP.&nbsp; A simple Google search
for the string "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22save+windows+xp%22">save
windows XP</a>" results in over 200 thousand hits.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I forgot -- Steve probably doesn't use Google. &nbsp;Maybe
the problem is that he just can't find any XP fans on the Internets?&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Or maybe Ballmer is following the now fashionable trend of
counting an Internet person as only 3/5 of a real person?</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Sure, Ron Paul has lots of fanatical supporters, but they're
     mostly just people on the Internet, and they don't really count.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Sure, Barack Obama has raised truckloads of money, but he
     mostly gets it from people on the Internet, and they don't really count.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Sure, over 170 thousand people have signed the <a
     href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/save-xp/">Save Windows XP petition</a>,
     but those people are on the Internet, so they don't really count.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or maybe this is simply the most arrogant corporate decision
in history?&nbsp; Maybe Steve can hear all of these desperate cries but he simply
doesn't care.</p>

<p>Power corrupts.&nbsp; Every monstrously large organization
eventually turns into, well, a monster.&nbsp; The next step is for all these
organizations to start borrowing each other's tactics.&nbsp; Hey Steve, why not
start waterboarding everybody who won't switch to Windows Vista?&nbsp; Apparently
it's legal.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>The whole situation is most annoying to those of us who are
running small software companies.&nbsp; Unlike Microsoft, we actually have to listen
to our customers.&nbsp; When they tell us to jump, we ask how high.</p>

<p>Microsoft is telling millions of its customers to jump.&nbsp; Out
of principle, I am doing my best not to comply:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I'm typing this blog entry on Windows XP.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >That instance of Windows XP is actually a VMware image
     running on my Mac.&nbsp; I started using a MacBook Pro with Leopard a couple
     months ago.&nbsp; And I love it.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I just donated fifty bucks to the <a
     href="http://www.reactos.org/">ReactOS</a> project.&nbsp; I'm figuring that in
     the long run, I've got a better chance of getting Windows XP from ReactOS
     than from Redmond.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of my readers are horrified at this blog entry.&nbsp; "But
Eric, aren't you a .NET developer?"</p>

<p>Yes, I am.&nbsp; My overall posture toward Microsoft is still
friendly.&nbsp; I still use Windows every day.&nbsp; I still love Visual Studio.&nbsp; C# is
still my favorite language ever.&nbsp; Heck, I'm even a big WPF fan, so I'd actually
prefer to see the world switch to Vista.&nbsp; I've used Vista, and while I didn't
find it to be a compelling "must-have" upgrade, I rather liked it.</p>

<p>But none of this means that I'm going to give my blanket
agreement to every decision Microsoft makes.&nbsp; In this case, I object to
Microsoft's plan, not because Vista is so awful, but rather, because ignoring
customers is so wrong.</p>
