<p>Well, since I <a
href="/entries/BrilliantPhoto.html">posted</a> about the
BrilliantPhoto auction on eBay, I guess I need to post a followup.&nbsp; The problem
is that there isn't much to say.</p>

<p>I guess I'd have to say that this eBay auction was not
successful.&nbsp; Jim Lamb (the seller) killed the auction early, apparently because
he was in the process of working out a deal with somebody separate from the
eBay auction.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A number of people were very <a
href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.241166.40">disappointed</a>
about this.&nbsp; I don't blame them -- I was disappointed too.&nbsp; As I said in my
first post, the cool thing about this was the ability to watch.&nbsp; Now the deal
is going to happen behind closed doors, which, of course, is the way this kind
of thing usually gets done.</p>

<p>I'm not saying I blame Jim for doing what make sense for him.&nbsp;
I'm just saying his sale isn't interesting anymore.&nbsp; Move along folks, nothing
to see here...&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
