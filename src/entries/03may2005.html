<p>Ian Olsen started yesterday as the newest member of the SourceGear team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's nice having a newbie around.&nbsp; The first week for a new developer at SourceGear is basically always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>The other developers circle around him like vultures, hoping to dump their undesirable tasks on "the new guy".
</li>
<li>It takes him a day or so to realize that our office space has two main hallways, not one.
</li>
<li>A couple days later he realizes that our office space has <em>three</em> main hallways, not two.&nbsp; Things suddenly get much easier to find.
</li>
<li>It takes him a week to get familiar with the alarm system, usually causing at least one police visit along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless Ian turns out to be a raving idiot, this hiring process looks like a success.&nbsp; The <a href="/entries/job_opening_feb2005.html">job posting</a> here on my blog was the only advertisement of the position (except I ran a classified ad in the local <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/">newspaper</a> which contained little more than the URL of that blog entry).&nbsp; We were fortunate enough to get only about 20 applicants, with an average level of cluefulness that was surprisingly high.&nbsp; This was so much better than getting 200 applicants, 198 of which have terrible misconceptions about what a garbage collector is.</p>
<p>Several of the applicants were local folks, and quite a few applied from various other cities in the Midwest.&nbsp; In fact, I'm not sure anybody applied from a region with nicer weather than ours.&nbsp; Ian is moving here from Detroit, so I daresay he's getting an upgrade.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>The only bummer was the necessity of saying "no" to the others who applied.&nbsp; The top few candidates were very close.&nbsp; After facing a bit of temptation, we decided to stay with our plan of hiring only one developer, at least for now.</p>
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; This hiring process worked well for us.&nbsp; Next time we hire a developer, we'll do it this way again.</p>
