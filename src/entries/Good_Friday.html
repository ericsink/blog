<p>I'm not Catholic.&nbsp; I grew up churched in a little Anabaptist
twig off the Protestant branch of Christianity.</p>

<p>Not having grown up Catholic, I lack the necessary
experience to really be able to feel guilty about <i>everything</i>.&nbsp; But a
sense of brotherhood with my Catholic friends compels me to try to feel guilty
about as many things as I can.</p>

<p>But for now I will mention just one thing:&nbsp; I feel guilty
that we are not using <a
href="http://www.automatedqa.com/products/testcomplete/">TestComplete</a>.&nbsp; Our
team's doctrinal statement says we believe in automated testing.&nbsp; We are
religious users of NUnit.&nbsp; We have around a dozen more automated testing apps
which are a part of our process.&nbsp; But we currently have no way of automatically
testing the user interface of our product.</p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with AutomatedQA and their
product.&nbsp; We should be using it, but thus far, we are not.&nbsp; I am scum.&nbsp; I am a
pitiful wretch.&nbsp; My actions are inexcusable.</p>

<p>However, I take comfort in the knowledge that some of you
are even more depraved than I am.&nbsp; You are not even using NUnit and you know
that you should be.&nbsp; Shame on you.</p>

<p>Regardless of your religious background or beliefs, today is
a great day to feel guilty about how horrible your team's development processes
are.&nbsp; Repent and get your life in order.</p>
