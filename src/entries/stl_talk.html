title: Speaking: 11 July in St. Louis

<p>On July 11th I will be speaking at the <a href="http://stlcsharp.net/">St. Louis C# User Group</a>.&nbsp; This is [apparently] a sub-group of the <a href="http://www.stlnet.org/">St. Louis .NET User Group</a>.</p>
<p>My presentation will be based on an article I am writing which will be published here on my weblog shortly after that meeting.&nbsp; I sent the organizers the following snippet from the article as an abstract:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Luckily, a lot of this "non computer science stuff" is fairly intuitive.&nbsp; We've got no training and no experience on such matters, but if we can figure out how to write a multithreaded network server, we can probably rent office space without screwing it up too badly.&nbsp; But one area consistently confounds us.<?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = CD /?>
&nbsp; In my opinion, nothing in a small ISV is more difficult for a geek than market competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can understand deep abstractions and object oriented programming.&nbsp; We have no problem grasping how virtual memory works.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us can even remember the keystrokes to do a search and replace in vi.&nbsp; But when geeks start talking about the issues of software product strategy in a competitive market, otherwise intelligent people suddenly sound like Paris Hilton.&nbsp; We just don't get it.&nbsp; Geeks understand market competition about as well as married men understand their wives.</p>
<p>But my convictions remain unchanged, so I am always looking for ways to explain this topic in terms that geeks will find intuitive.&nbsp; Along those lines, this article proceeds from a single observation:&nbsp; Geeks don't understand marketing, but they <em>do</em> understand games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> What does this article have to do with C# ?&nbsp; Not sure.&nbsp; I hope to figure that out between now and the meeting.&nbsp; :-)</p>
