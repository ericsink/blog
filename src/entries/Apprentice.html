title: SourceGear Job Opening:  Product Manager

<p>This posting is about a job opening at SourceGear.&nbsp; The
official title for this position will be &quot;Product Manager&quot; (or
something similar).&nbsp; </p>

<p>But another possible title for this position would be
&quot;Eric's Apprentice&quot;.</p>

<h3>What kind of position is this?</h3>

<p>This is a product marketing position.&nbsp; Areas of
responsibility will include strategy, message, positioning and competition.</p>

<h3>So I need marketing experience for this job?</h3>

<p>No.&nbsp; In fact, if you have any, I'll be wondering how much
stuff you'll have to unlearn.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<h3>So what kind of experience do I need for this job?</h3>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >You need to be a software developer.&nbsp; I'm looking for a
     coder who wants to make the transition to the business side.&nbsp; You should
     have substantial experience as a programmer, including work on a team
     using version control and bug tracking software.</li>
 <li >If your development experience was on software product (as
     opposed to something like corporate IT), that's a big plus.</li>
 <li >You need to have a strong interest and aptitude for
     marketing and strategy.</li>
 <li >You need to be an excellent communicator and a good
     writer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why do I have to be a developer to get a marketing job?</h3>

<p>Because your customers and coworkers will be developers, and
neither group will put up with you being a bozo.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Just to be a clear, the word "bozo" does not mean
"non-developer".&nbsp; The word "bozo" means "someone who doesn't know the stuff
that his/her job requires him/her to know".&nbsp; A software company usually employs
lots of people who are not developers and not bozos.&nbsp; They work in several different
areas, including sales, accounting, customer service, technical support or
marketing communications.&nbsp; There isn't much need for any of them to have a
software development background.</p>

<p>But product marketing is one job where it really helps to be
cut from the same cloth as the customer.&nbsp; You are steering the direction of the
product.&nbsp; You need the ability to make decisions about what's important.&nbsp; You must
be able to talk about design tradeoffs both externally and internally.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We sell developer tools to software teams, so I'm looking
for a developer.&nbsp; If we were selling software to manage bowling alleys I would
be insisting that you are a bowler.</p>

<h3>Why would any developer <i>want</i> to switch to marketing?</h3>

<p>You love to develop software, but you want to consider a
broader range of opportunities.&nbsp; Maybe you're looking up the corporate ladder
and noticing that all the rungs above you require some business savvy.&nbsp; Maybe
you want to be an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Whatever your goals are, I'm looking for someone who wants
to follow the same career path I have.&nbsp; Start with good developer skills and then
add business and marketing skills and you end up with a <i>very</i> potent
combination.</p>

<h3>The title is "Product Manager"?&nbsp; So is this a management position?</h3>

<p>No.&nbsp; That's not what "Product Manager" means.&nbsp; You'll be
managing the product, not the people who create the product.</p>

<h3>The title is "Apprentice"?&nbsp; So is this a junior level position?</h3>

<p>No.&nbsp; I'm using the word "apprentice" somewhat
tongue-in-cheek.&nbsp; The Product Manager is one of the most influential roles in the
company.&nbsp; This position would be a peer of the person who manages the
development team.&nbsp; You need significant industry experience for this job.&nbsp; If
you are fresh out of college, it is very unlikely you are qualified.</p>

<p>I just explained all the ways that the word "apprentice"
doesn't actually fit this situation.&nbsp; The primary way that this word <i>does</i>
fit is that it's a marketing position but you don't need any marketing
experience.&nbsp; You'll learn that stuff as you go.</p>

<h3>How much will this position pay?</h3>

<p>I don't have a specific number in mind, but I'm looking for
an experienced developer and I certainly don't think of this position as a step
down.&nbsp; I expect this position will be compensated at a level similar to that of
a senior developer or development team lead.</p>

<h3>An "Apprentice"?&nbsp; Is this going to be like Donald Trump's TV show?</h3>

<p>No.&nbsp; I'm thinking more along the lines of the &quot;Cruel
Tutelage of Pai Mei&quot; chapter from <a
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0378194/">Kill Bill</a>.&nbsp; Your experience at
SourceGear will be grueling and painful, but it will transform you into a
powerful assassin, or the software industry equivalent thereof.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<h3>What education do I need?</h3>

<p>A degree in computer science or software engineering is
preferred but not strictly required.</p>

<h3>Can I work part-time in marketing and part-time as a developer?</h3>

<p>No.&nbsp; You can have a compiler if you want, but you will not
be writing production code.</p>

<h3>Where will this position be located?</h3>

<p>Short answer:&nbsp; Illinois.</p>

<p>Long answer:&nbsp; There is some flexibility, but geography will
be an issue.&nbsp; Basically, this position would work out best if you are located
in Champaign or within a few hours driving distance.&nbsp; For example, if you live
in Chicago and can spend two days a week in Champaign, that would be fine.&nbsp; Anything
on the east or west coast is probably going to be too difficult.</p>

<h3>Will travel be necessary?</h3>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; Plan on more than 6 trips per year and less than 12.</p>

<h3>Are you actually as arrogant as the tone of this blog entry suggests you
are?</h3>

<p>No, but the whole thing reads so much better that way, don't
you think?</p>

<p>And I'm mostly kidding about the "grueling and painful"
part.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>:-)</b></p>
