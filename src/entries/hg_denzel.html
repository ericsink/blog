<p>People keep asking me why I don't talk more about Mercurial
in this series of blog entries.&nbsp; There's a simple answer to that question:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Mercurial isn't very interesting.</p>

<p>Wait, that didn't come out quite right.&nbsp; Let me try again:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Git is Wesley Snipes.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Mercurial is Denzel Washington</p>

<p>Hmm, that probably needs further explanation.&nbsp; First let me
give a little background.</p>

<p>I am the founder of a version control software company.&nbsp;
I've done lots of writing about the topic here on my blog.&nbsp; Currently I am in
the process of revising and expanding all those writings to turn them into a
book.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As part of that effort, I have undertaken an exploration of
the DVCS world.&nbsp; Several weeks ago I started writing one blog entry every week,
mostly focused on DVCS topics.&nbsp; In chronological order, here they are:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/git_index.html">one</a>
     where I gripe about Git's index</li>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/git_immutability.html">one</a>
     where I whine about the way Git allows developers to rearrange the DAG</li>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/dvcs_dag_1.html">one</a>
     where it looks like I am against DAG-based version control but I'm really
     not</li>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/dvcs_dag_2.html">one</a>
     where I fuss about DVCSes that try to act like centralized tools</li>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/dbts_fossil.html">one</a>
     where I complain that DVCSes have a lousy story when it comes to
     bug-tracking</li>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/merge_history.html">one</a>
     where I lament that I want to like Darcs but I can't</li>
 <li >The <a href="/entries/why_is_git_fast.html">one</a>
     where I speculate cluelessly about why Git is so fast</li>
</ul>

<p>Along the way, I've been spending some time getting hands-on
experience with these tools.&nbsp; I've been using Bazaar for several months.&nbsp; I
don't like it very much.&nbsp; I am currently in the process of switching to Git,
but I don't expect to like it very much either.</p>

<p>Why am I using these tools if I don't like them?&nbsp; Because I
want the experience.&nbsp; I don't want to write hearsay.&nbsp; I want to live with these
tools and see what I learn.</p>

<p>So why don't I write about Mercurial?&nbsp; Because I'm pretty
sure I would like it.</p>

<p>I chose Bazaar and Git for the experience.&nbsp; But if I were
choosing a DVCS as a regular user, I would choose Mercurial.&nbsp; I've used it
some, and found it to be incredibly pleasant.&nbsp; It seems like the DVCS that got
everything just about right.&nbsp; That's great if you're a user, but for a writer,
what's interesting about that?</p>

<p>Denzel Washington is a great actor.&nbsp; Other than that, he
lives a pretty normal life.&nbsp; What's interesting about that?</p>

<p>In contrast, Wesley Snipes gives the world lots of things to
write about.&nbsp; Tax evasion.&nbsp; Conviction for reckless driving.&nbsp; Martial arts.</p>

<p>People admire Denzel Washington.&nbsp; But Wesley Snipes is
simply more interesting.</p>

<p>I admire Mercurial.&nbsp; But Git is more interesting.&nbsp; Like
Snipes, Git is an odd juxtaposition of great power with some quirky flaws and
failings.</p>

<p>One more thing:</p>

<p>People also ask me why I don't write more about Subversion.&nbsp;
That's easy too:</p>

<p>Subversion is Morgan Freeman.</p>
