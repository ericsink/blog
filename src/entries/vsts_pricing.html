<p>The .NET blogging community is buzzing with entries about the recent announcement of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rickla/archive/2005/03/22.aspx">pricing</a> for Team System.&nbsp; People keep asking me to chime in, so here goes:</p>
<p>Many of the blog entries I've seen are <a href="http://scrappydog.com/blog/archive/2005/03/22/1485.aspx">leaning</a> toward the <a href="http://www.larkware.com/editorials/vs2005.html">negative</a>.&nbsp; A lot of folks are complaining.&nbsp; People tend to complain when their expectations are not met.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be helpful to identify which expectations were not met and why that happened.</p>
<h4>The perceived entitlements of MSDN Universal</h4>
<p>I observe that most MSDN Universal subscribers have an expectation which looks something like this:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><em>As an MSDN Universal subscriber, I get everything Microsoft sells.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given this expectation, it is easy to understand why people are upset.&nbsp; For these people, the world is about to change.&nbsp; Current MSDN Universal subscribers will <em>not</em> get everything in Team System.&nbsp; (They get a free upgrade to <em>one</em> of the three "role products", but not all three, and they still don't get the server.)&nbsp; The retail price of the new incarnation of "MSDN Everything" has gone from $2,799 to $10,939.&nbsp; And on top of this apparently outrageous price increase, the top tier of MSDN no longer has "everything".</p>
<p>But it never did.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of the underlying problem.&nbsp; The expectation above was never completely valid.&nbsp; MSDN Universal subscribers receive a seemingly endless stream of CDs or DVDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those discs do contain [basically] everything Microsoft sells, but there is a difference between having the bits and having the right to use them.&nbsp; The contents of those discs are provided under the terms of a license which specifies how the software may be used.&nbsp; I daresay that a majority of MSDN Universal subscribers violate the terms of the license.&nbsp; This happens in two ways:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p>Many companies and teams buy a single subscription and share it among all their developers.&nbsp; This form of piracy is rampant.&nbsp; Some folks probably even think it's legal.&nbsp; It's not.</p>
<p>We encounter this all the time when talking to people about our own products.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>User:&nbsp; "Why should I buy Vault when SourceSafe is free?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>SourceGear:&nbsp; "Why do you think SourceSafe is free?"</p>
<p>User:&nbsp; "Because it's on the MSDN discs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have ten developers using Visual Studio, you're supposed to have ten subscriptions to MSDN Universal.&nbsp; That's the way it works.</p>
<p><strong>Developer licenses</strong></p>
<p>Many people use "developer licenses" outside their intended use.&nbsp; This one is even more subtle.&nbsp; The discs in your MSDN subscription contain lots of things which are licensed for development purposes only.&nbsp; I suppose only Microsoft can explain exactly what this means, but I have understood it like this:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I can use SQL Server Developer Edition when I am developing an application which uses SQL Server.&nbsp; However, if I need SQL Server for my company's accounting system, I need to buy a full license elsewhere.</li>
<li>I can use Windows Server 2003 for development and testing, but if I want to host my company's online store, I need to buy a full license elsewhere.
&nbsp;
</li>
<li><strike>I can use Microsoft Office from my MSDN disc if I am developing an Excel plugin.&nbsp; However, if I need Word to edit my business plan, I need to buy a full license elsewhere.</strike>
&nbsp; <em>(Oops!&nbsp; Bad example.&nbsp; This is</em> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/howtobuy/subscribers/msdnuniversal/default.aspx"><em>incorrect</em></a><em>.)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about dev tools like FogBugz, Dragnet or Vault?&nbsp; These tools store their data in SQL Server.&nbsp; Surely we can use the SQL Server bits on the MSDN discs for these purposes, right?&nbsp; After all, this is "development".</p>
<p>This may seem to be a grey area, but I think the rules are clear.&nbsp; Using these apps require real SQL licenses, not the developer licenses which come with MSDN.</p>
<p>MSDN has never included licenses to use Microsoft's server products.&nbsp; Team Foundation Server is no different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most MSDN Universal subscribers believe that they are getting tens of thousands of dollars of software for $2,799 retail.&nbsp; Believing this doesn't make it true.</p>
<p>Please note, I am not accusing anyone in particular of piracy or cheating.&nbsp; A reasonable and honest person who is completely legal on their use of the stuff on the MSDN discs might still be quite dismayed over the new pricing.&nbsp; Even if you are one of the savvy people who already understood that there is a gap between MSDN Universal and "everything", that gap just got a lot wider.</p>
<p>I'm not asking every MSDN subscriber to be happy about the pricing -- I am merely surfacing a very general expectation which I think is part of the unhappiness.</p>
<p>And I'm also saying that I think the pricing actually makes sense for Microsoft and its strategy.&nbsp; Read on...</p>
<h4>The target market for Visual Studio Team System</h4>
<p>It's easy to understand why people became excited about Team System.&nbsp; Microsoft is finally getting truly serious about source control and bug-tracking and test-driven development.&nbsp; Why not be excited?</p>
<p>The problem here is that many of those excited people are not really within Team System's apparent target market.</p>
<p>The intersection between the real enterprise software market and the .NET blogging community is probably very small.&nbsp; I therefore feel justified in making the following sweeping generalization to my readers:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Visual Studio Team System wasn't really designed for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ten months ago I <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/item_10169.html">said</a> Team System was positioned as a competitor to ClearCase.&nbsp; Now that the pricing is public information, people are beginning to understand this idea.&nbsp; Another wave of complaints will follow later when people actually try to install and use Team System.&nbsp; This product is very, very large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I think Microsoft made a mistake in setting expectations when they originally said Team System was designed for teams of 5 or more people.&nbsp; I suppose Microsoft will eventually refine this product to the point where it is more appropriate for smaller teams.&nbsp; But right now and for the indefinite future, it is inconceivable to me that a 5 person team would want to install and use this thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I envision 5 people trying to take a 747 jet to McDonalds for a burger when a minivan will obviously get them there more efficiently.</p>
<p>I crossed paths recently with a company who I consider to be a pretty good target customer for Team System.&nbsp; Let's call them XYZ Corporation.&nbsp; They have 8,000 developers.&nbsp; Their source control repository is 15 terabytes.&nbsp; These people have a whole different class of problems, and those problems are the ones that Team System is being designed to solve.&nbsp; When Microsoft claims that Team System is designed for the enterprise customer, they're not kidding.</p>
<h4>It's all about Tiers</h4>
<p>The Visual Studio 2005 family of products is probably the best example I have ever seen of using <a href="/bos/Product_Pricing.html">tiers</a> to extract the right amount of money from a wide variety of customers.&nbsp; Microsoft's basic goal here is to sell Visual Studio to <em>everyone</em> who writes code.</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2003 was tiered as well, but Microsoft apparently realized they were doing a lousy job at the very low end and the very high end.&nbsp; With 2005, they have added tiers to help Visual Studio reach a wider audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new "Express" editions reach out to the student and the hobbyist.&nbsp; Microsoft loses a lot of these people to Linux and its ilk.
</li>
<li>The new "Team" editions reach out to the enterprise.&nbsp; Microsoft loses a lot of these people to Rational/IBM and some to Borland.
</li>
</ul>
<p>But every company which uses a tier strategy has to face complaints from customers in one tier who want the features of the next tier without paying for them.&nbsp; I have a Chevy Avalanche with the 5 liter engine.&nbsp; I wish it had the 8 liter engine in the next tier.&nbsp; I complain about it.</p>
<p>A lot of Visual Studio developers in the "Professional" tier are complaining that they want the stuff in the "Team" tier.&nbsp; In other words, they may <em>understand</em> that they are not the target market for Team System, but they are not <em>happy</em> about it.&nbsp; They want source control.&nbsp; They want bug-tracking.&nbsp; They want unit testing.&nbsp; Placing those features in the "Team" tier does not meet their expectations.&nbsp; So they complain.</p>
<p>Microsoft is the largest software company in the world.&nbsp; They are utterly dominant in some markets, but they are utterly irrelevant in others, including the market for enterprise-class lifecycle development tools.&nbsp; It is important to realize that Microsoft is facing very difficult competition in this market.&nbsp; They have some major catching up to do.&nbsp; Success is <em>not</em> guaranteed.</p>
<p>If I were to advise Microsoft on how to fail in this challenge, I would tell them to try and please the enterprise customer and the folks in the "Professional" tier at the same time.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>But Microsoft is smart.&nbsp; They are designing a product to win and they are pricing it accordingly.&nbsp; That is IMNSHO the right strategy for them.&nbsp; Team System is already a lot cheaper than its competition.&nbsp; If they priced it dramatically lower than it is now, the target market would not take it seriously.&nbsp; Remember, the people in that target market already hold a negative view of Microsoft's ability to deliver this kind of product.</p>
<p>I believe Microsoft will succeed.&nbsp; Team System is going to be an incredible product.&nbsp; It raises the bar in a number of ways that I believe are truly unique.&nbsp; It will take some time before it attains the level of polish and maturity now available with ClearCase, BitKeeper or Perforce.&nbsp; But they will get there.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday Microsoft will bring some or all of the features in the "Team" tier to the broader market.&nbsp; But right now I completely understand why they feel the need to stay focused.</p>
<h4>Yes, yes, I know -- I'm biased</h4>
<p>My regular readers know that I take pleasure in my ability to be objective.&nbsp; When I admire a competitor, I admit it.&nbsp; When my own product is lame, I admit it.</p>
<p>Obviously, I have some bias with respect to the all these Team System issues:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>My company sells Vault (a source control tool) and Dragnet (a bug-tracking tool).&nbsp; Our target market consists primarily of the folks in the so-called "Professional" tier, exactly the set of people who are unhappy about the pricing of Team System.&nbsp; I have no interest in making Vault into the solution for those nasty CM problems at XYZ Corporation.
</li>
<li>We are also going to be selling add-on products for Team System.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I announced a project we call <a href="/entries/allerton.html">Allerton</a>.&nbsp; It's vaporware right now, but we'll be showing demos at Tech-Ed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>So in two different ways, I am too involved to be truly objective.</p>
<p>But I tried to lay my biases aside when I wrote this piece, and I hope you will look beyond them as you read it.&nbsp; I wrote this to offer a perspective that I hope will be helpful.&nbsp; The mismatch of expectations is not surprising when you look at both sides, but I think there are good reasons why Microsoft has made the decisions they have made.</p>
