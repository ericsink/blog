<p>Pardon the exclamation point, but I'm excited.&nbsp; Sometime in
the next few weeks I am going to walk in to my local Borders bookstore and see
a book on the shelf with my name on it.&nbsp; I'll try not to make a scene.</p>

<p>After what seems like an eternity of proofreading, today is
the day that my book <img width=288 height=431 src="/scm/1579_image001.jpg"
align=right hspace=12>is being sent off to be printed.&nbsp; The book is essentially
a collection of essays from here on my weblog, each one edited and prefaced
with an introduction.</p>

<p>This is my first book.&nbsp; I'm sure every first-time author
says this, but I feel the need:&nbsp; I can't believe how much work this was.&nbsp; Bear
in mind that this book consists mostly of content which I had already written.&nbsp;
Even still, it required a stunning amount of effort.&nbsp; It boggles the mind to
think about writing a book where I would actually have to write the book.&nbsp; My
respect for <i>real</i> authors has increased throughout this process.</p>

<p>Anyway, the book is available for pre-ordering on <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596234/sawdust08-20">Amazon</a>
now.</p>

<p>In fact, it has been possible to pre-order it for several
months.</p>

<p>In fact, you could have pre-ordered this book on Amazon
before I had decided on the table of contents, before I had submitted a single
first draft, before I had a signed contract with the publisher.&nbsp; The world of
book publishing is just a little weird.</p>
