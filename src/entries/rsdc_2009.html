<p>Anybody attending the <a
href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/rsdc/">Rational Software
Conference</a> in Orlando next week?</p>

<p>I've been making very last-minute plans to be there for some
meetings, but I'll have some free time, and it's always cool to connect a face
with an email address.&nbsp; So if you're a reader of my blog and will be at the
Rational conference next week, drop me an <a
href="/about_author.html">email</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, yes I know this blog entry should really have been
a tweet.&nbsp; I just haven't gotten into the Twitter thing at all yet, but this
very moment is the first time I've thought maybe I should.&nbsp; :-)</p>
