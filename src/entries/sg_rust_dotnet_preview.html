<p>A few weeks ago I posted a <a href="/entries/dotnet_rust.html">blog entry</a> about stuff I've been
building to compile Rust code for .NET.</p>

<p>You wanna try it?  <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>First let me try to scare away the sane people.</p>

<h2>Coder Beware</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p>This project is not production ready.</p></li>
    <li><p>Think of this as just a demo or a proof of concept.</p></li>
    <li><p>Don't even think about trying to use this for real work.</p></li>
    <li><p>Lots of things are broken or incomplete.</p></li>
    <li><p>This has never been used to write anything but Hello World and test cases.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is not open source.</p></li>
    <li><p>I am making no promises about the future of this project.</p></li>
    <li><p>If more releases happen in the future, things may change with no regard whatsoever for backward compatibility.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This preview release is simply for interested folks who
want to fiddle around with Rust and .NET.</p>

<h2>Preview release 0.1.0</h2>

<p>Making a release of this project has forced me to give it a name, so I'm calling it SourceGear.Rust.NET.
The preview release consists of two NuGet packages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>SourceGear.Rust.NET.Templates -- for use with `dotnet new`</p></li>
    <li><p>SourceGear.Rust.NET.Sdk -- an MSBuild Sdk</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You'll need .NET Core 3.1 on one of the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Windows (x64)</p></li>
    <li><p>MacOS</p></li>
    <li><p>Ubuntu 18.04 (x64)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(The Sdk includes a native code library (libLLVM), and for now, I am only bundling it for the 3 platforms above.)</p>

<p>And you'll need Rust nightly, plus its `rust-src` component.</p>

<pre class="screen">
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
</pre>

<p>First, install the templates:</p>

<pre class="screen">
dotnet new -i SourceGear.Rust.NET.Templates
</pre>

<p>Now create a project:</p>

<pre class="screen">
mkdir MyRustProject1
cd MyRustProject1
dotnet new console -lang Rust
</pre>

<p>The project directory should now contain an .rsproj file.  This is very similar to a .csproj or .fsproj, except of course that it's for Rust.</p>

<p>The source code for the console app is in `src/main.rs`, and it's pretty ugly at the moment, because there is a bunch of ceremony at the top that I need to find a way to move out.</p>

<p>Now build:</p>

<pre class="screen">
dotnet build
</pre>

<p>This will take quite a while and you'll see a bunch of
output scrolling by.  Subsequent builds of the project will be quicker
because the Rust core library and the .NET Core bindings are already
compiled.</p>

<p>If the build succeeds, try running the app:</p>

<pre class="screen">
dotnet run
</pre>

<p>And you should see it say Hello World.</p>

<h2>Limitations:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p>The Sdk's compiler can only target .NET Core 3.1.  No netstandard, no Xamarin, no Mono, no .NET Framework.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Rust std library is absent.  Only core and alloc.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Sdk only works with Rust nightly, not stable.</p></li>
    <li><p>There is no support yet for Rust code referencing other assemblies (besides .NET Core itself).</p></li>
    <li><p>The bindings for .NET Core are missing quite a few methods.</p></li>
</ul>
