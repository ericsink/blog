     href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/releases/3.1.0.html">several

     <br>
 </li>
 <li ><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads.html">Vault

     href="http://ianolsen.wordpress.com/2007/10/25/vault-405fortress-105-ships/">improvements</a>.<br>
     <br>

 <li >Our comic ads have continued to move forward, with
     episodes 1 through 9 of the arc now <a
     href="http://www.sourcegear.com/TEM/TEMads.html">available</a>.&nbsp; We just
     finalized and sent off episode 10, so it should be posted soon.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >SourceGear is exhibiting at <a
     href="http://www.devconnections.com/">DevConnections</a> in Las Vegas this week.&nbsp; This event is a bittersweet moment for me.&nbsp; I believe it is the first
     time Vault is being promoted at a tradeshow without me being there.&nbsp; I
     wanted to go, but it just didn't work out with my schedule.&nbsp; Anyway,
     several other SourceGear staff members are there, so if you're in Vegas
     for the show, stop by our booth and say hello.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >For the last few months I have been working on a major
     upgrade for our online store.&nbsp; Initially I approached this project with a
     sense of dread.&nbsp; I love to write code, but the glue between a web browser
     and a SQL database is probably my least favorite type of programming.&nbsp;
     Still, once I got into it, I gained a lot of enthusiasm for the effort.&nbsp;
     It's almost done now and will be deployed soon.&nbsp; I think this new store is
     going to enable us to do a much better job serving our customers.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Finally, it is high time that I give mention here on my
     blog to the departure of Dan Schreiber from SourceGear.&nbsp; Dan was the very
     first person I hired in 1997.&nbsp; Corey Steffen was the second, just a few
     weeks later.&nbsp; The three of us developed a fantastic working relationship,
     with a level of trust and communication that is truly rare in business.&nbsp; In
     2004, we formally restructured the company with Corey, Dan and I as three equal
     partners.&nbsp; <br>
     <br>
     In the spring of 2006, Dan left SourceGear (with full support from Corey
     and myself) to take a sabbatical, uncertain about whether he would return.&nbsp;
     He spent the next year or so considering a career change, and eventually
     decided that it was time for him to leave the software field and focus on
     other things.&nbsp; So Corey and I accepted his resignation and purchased his
     share of the company.&nbsp; <br>
     <br>
     On October 13<sup>th</sup> we held a company party to give him the proper
     sendoff he deserved for his years of excellent work at SourceGear.&nbsp; He
     remains one of my dearest friends. &nbsp;All his former coworkers here wish him
     well.</li>
