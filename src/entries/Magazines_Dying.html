<p>I enjoy predicting the death of companies.&nbsp; Everybody needs
a hobby.&nbsp; I suppose mine is more cynical than some, so scratch me off the list
of good role models for your kids.</p>

<p>I'm pretty good at it, too.&nbsp; Nine years of running a
business has given me a certain amount of intuition about whether something is
going to "make it" or not.</p>

<p>Heck, if I could get my accuracy rate a bit higher and
improve my timing, I could make a business out of predicting the death of other
businesses.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly what the revenue model is, but it seems
obvious that if I could accurately tell people if and when a company is going
to fail, I could charge a lot of money for that service.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm not always right.&nbsp; For example, a nearby
restaurant has been defying my predictions for years.&nbsp; I really like the place,
but it's basically always empty.&nbsp; I can't imagine how they pay the rent.&nbsp; On
more than one occasion I have wondered if the place is a front for something
illegal, but I'm pretty sure my conjectures are not enough for anybody to get a
search warrant.</p>

<p>Accuracy in my projections is hard.&nbsp; Timing is much harder.&nbsp;
Even when it is obvious that a business will fail, it can be incredibly
difficult to know just when it will happen.&nbsp; Sometimes my guesses are pretty
good, but in other cases, I've missed by months or even years.&nbsp; If the company
doesn't have much debt, it can cut costs and lay around on life support for an
absurdly long time.</p>

<p>There's a camera shop here in Champaign.&nbsp; It's doomed.&nbsp;
Nature has selected this kind of camera shop for extinction, but the owner of
this particular store is fighting back.&nbsp; The newspaper recently reported that he
has laid off everyone but himself.&nbsp; That will help keep his doors open, but it
doesn't help me at all.&nbsp; Now I don't know what date to choose for my prediction!&nbsp;
He could close up shop tomorrow or he could keep going for years.&nbsp; It's hard to
tell.</p>

<h3>New companies, old companies</h3>

<p>Suppose my hobby were a game and we needed a way to keep
score.&nbsp; For correctly predicting the death of a specific company, you can get a
maximum score of say 10 points.&nbsp; But timing is critical, so you have to specify
a date.&nbsp; If you get the date pretty close, then you get the full 10 points.&nbsp; If
you miss, a penalty will be deducted.&nbsp; The worse you miss, the fewer points you
get.</p>

<p>The eventual rules of scoring will end up incredibly
complicated.&nbsp; For example, all else equal, public companies need to be worth a
lot less than ones which are privately held.&nbsp; Plus we need ways of resolving
disputes over whether a company really died or not.</p>

<p>Here's another scoring problem:&nbsp; New businesses die
quickly.&nbsp; Old businesses die slowly.</p>

<p>Predicting the death of a new company is a relatively simple
matter.&nbsp; If they're going to fail, they're probably going to do it soon.&nbsp; Many
such businesses never develop a reasonable revenue model of any kind.&nbsp; Others
die in the <a href="/Act_Your_Age.html">chasm</a>, taking
all the money they can from the early adopters but never crossing over into the
land of the pragmatists where all the big bucks are.</p>

<p>But old businesses are much trickier, and the timing can be
nearly impossible.&nbsp; After 150 years of operation, Western Union's telegram
business was shut down on 27 January 2006.&nbsp; It wasn't too hard to see this
coming, but how would I have gotten even close to the right date?</p>

<p>So if new companies are worth 10 points, old companies
should be worth maybe a 100 or so.&nbsp; This is especially true now that we've got
dozens of ridiculous "Web 2.0" companies sprouting up like crabgrass. &nbsp;If I
correctly predict the death of something really tricky like Sun Microsystems,
while you correctly predict the death of five startups doing web calendaring, I
should still have the higher score.</p>

<h3>Developer magazines</h3>

<p>One specific situation that has kept me stumped is figuring
out exactly when the software development magazines are going to die.</p>

<p>I correctly resisted the temptation to predict their
imminent death back when the Web was starting to become ubiquitous.&nbsp; For a
while it was fashionable to predict that the Web would eliminate publishing, or
at least that it would eliminate magazine publishing.&nbsp; Ten years later, most of
these pubs are still around.</p>

<p>But there is obviously some truth here.&nbsp; Today's
developer-focused magazines are looking very sickly indeed.&nbsp; The health of a
magazine is very closely correlated with its page count.&nbsp; Note the following:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The March 2006 issue of <a
     href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/">Software Development</a> (CMP) is 56
     pages.</li>
 <li >Recent issues of <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/vsm/">Visual
     Studio Magazine</a> (Fawcette) have been either 56 or 64 pages.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >After years of clinging to life at 48 pages, C/C++ User
     Journal (CMP) recently <a
     href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++/msg/d56ed8793eb5ff1b?hl=en&amp;">ceased
     publication</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two days ago I stopped in at my local Borders bookstore and
noticed that not one of these magazines was available for sale.&nbsp; They carry
hundreds of periodicals.&nbsp; They have an entire shelf of magazines for
scrapbookers.&nbsp; They have niche titles like <a
href="http://www.centuryone.com/BAR.html">Biblical Archaeology Review</a>.&nbsp; But
I couldn't find a single pub which was focused at software developers.&nbsp; What's
up with that?</p>

<p>The unavoidable truth is that these magazines have largely
ceased to be relevant.&nbsp; More and more, software developers get their
information on the Web, not from a magazine.&nbsp; As just one example, compare the
quality of the technical content in any developer magazine against <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen's blog</a>.&nbsp; It's not
even close, and Chen's blog is <i>pure</i> content, as opposed to "tidbits of
content squeezed in between the ads".</p>

<p>Speaking of ads, people are going to start noticing that
SourceGear is currently not advertising in any developer magazine.&nbsp; This is a
big change for us.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that at least one SourceGear magazine ad
has been printed every month for the last 8 years.&nbsp; Next month, there will be none.</p>

<p>When I show up at Tech-Ed in June, I will no doubt encounter
several sales guys from these magazines.&nbsp; Each of them will try to convince me
that by choosing to stop advertising, I am giving their readers the impression
that SourceGear is dying.&nbsp; The irony seems very thick.&nbsp; My company is not the
one that is languishing here.</p>

<p>For the record, SourceGear is quite healthy.&nbsp; We don't share
our financials, but 2005 was our best year ever, and 2006 is probably going to
beat it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's not that we can't afford the ads.&nbsp; I'm just tired of
playing the game, so I'm taking a break.&nbsp; After Vault 4.0 comes out, maybe we'll
run some more ads to spread the word.</p>

<p>Or maybe we won't.&nbsp; Vault 4.0 is still probably 6-9 months
away.&nbsp; All these magazines might be gone by then.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>OK, probably not.&nbsp; Like I said, old businesses die slowly.&nbsp; Developer
magazines still have their place.&nbsp; Their market is shrinking, but it's not
gone, and I wouldn't be surprised if these pubs are still hanging on five years
from now.</p>

<p>But although I can't get the timing right, the signs are
clear.&nbsp; Developer magazines are dying.</p>
