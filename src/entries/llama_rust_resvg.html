keywords: rust dotnet llama
teaser: Fixing problems until an SVG rendering library kinda works
---

<p>My outer loop for working on the Llama Rust SDK currently looks like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
while (still_motivated())
{
    find_a_crate_that_doesnt_work();
    while (llama_is_crashing())
    {
        fix_something();
    }
    while (compiled_result_is_crashing())
    {
        fix_something();
    }
    while (compiled_result_is_wrong())
    {
        fix_something();
    }
    delude_self();
}
</pre>

<p>I consider this a perfectly fine development process for a side
project.  If Llama ever becomes something more serious, I'll
[try to] approach this with a bit more discipline.</p>

<p>When choosing a crate that doesn't work,
I do have to look for things that have a chance.  In terms
of platform-specific functionality, my current scope is
limited to "whatever is in .NET 5", so I don't even bother working
on something like a UI library or a game engine.</p>

<p>For this iteration, I chose an SVG rendering library I found on GitHub:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg">https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg</a></p>

<p>To get started, first I had to split the crate into two, so the executable and the library each have their own project.  Then I created an .rsproj file from the Cargo.toml so I could use <code>dotnet build</code>.  Both of these steps are described in more detail in a <a href="/entries/llama_rust_013.html">previous blog entry</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, each of the three inner loops lasted several days.  The first two loops are often the easy part.  When something crashes, I usually get enough clues to diagnose and find the actual problem.</p>

<p>That third loop can be rather painful.  
The program runs, and it thinks everything went fine, but the resulting output is just wrong.  
In this case, I'm rendering SVG into PNG files, so the symptoms are visual.  There is supposed to be a picture of couch, but there is not.  The star is the wrong color.  But these kinds of clues don't tell me much about where the incorrect code is.
</p>

<p>There are a variety of things I can try to isolate where the problem is, but this step is rarely straightforward.
Sometimes I discover that I'm chasing multiple problems that all look the same.  Very often I add a debug print statement and it completely changes what the LLVM optimizer does and the symptoms change or go away.</p>

<p>Finally, after fixing a whole bunch of bugs, I was able to successfully run:</p>

<pre class="screen">
dotnet run car.svg car.png
</pre>

<p>and get this:</p>

<p><img width="480" src="/images/svg_car.png"/></p>

<p>BTW, I found that car.svg file here:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/">https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/</a></p>

<p>The final step in the loop is <code>delude_self()</code>.  I'm not saying this is constructive, but I pause for this bit of silliness on every iteration, and I have no plans to stop.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Wow, it worked!</p></li>
    <li><p>Could I be done?</p></li>
    <li><p>Maybe that was the very last bug?</p></li>
    <li><p>Maybe everything is going to Just Work from now on?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, right.</p>

<p>Anyway...</p>

<p>I have published a new version of the Llama Rust SDK on nuget.org:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SourceGear.Rust.NET.Sdk/0.1.4">SourceGear.Rust.NET.Sdk version 0.1.4</a></p>

<h2>What got fixed</h2>

<p>I'll finish here with a list of things I fixed for this iteration.  Each
of the features in the unreadable wall of text below was either previously unimplemented or needed some 
kind of fix in order to get resvg working.</p>

<p>The thing I found remarkable is to think about the
previous projects that were working fine WITHOUT these fixes.  
I mean, there are dozens of items here.  How did anything work
at all?</p>

</p>

<p>Delusion aside, I won't be a bit surprised if the next
iteration involves a lot of fixes as well.</p>
