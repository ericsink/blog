<p>We get asked fairly often if we still offer free licenses
for single users.&nbsp; The answer is yes.</p>

<p>In fact, it's in our <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/faq.html">FAQ</a>:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span><b>Do you still
offer free licenses for single users?</b></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Yes. Both Vault and Fortress are
free of cost when used by a single user. Simply install the software and do not
enter any serial numbers (license keys) at all. When no license keys are
present, Vault and Fortress behave as if there is exactly one license
available.</p>

<p>We first introduced this with the release of Vault 2.0 back
in February 2004.</p>

<p>I should clarify here that this feature only works for a
team of one.&nbsp; For any team of N people where N&gt;1, you will need to purchase
N user licenses.</p>

<p>I should further clarify that when we refer to a "single
user", we are not making reference to the issue of marital status.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
