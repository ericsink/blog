<p>It's Friday afternoon, so I hope my readers will indulge me
a bit of gloating over three recent moments of personal triumph:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Playing the 12<sup>th</sup> hole at my <a
     href="http://uofigolf.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=38">regular
     course</a>, I made a shot from about 80 yards out.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was
     for par.&nbsp; <b>:-(</b><br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >This past Saturday I walked the <a
     href="http://www.500festival.com/marathon/2008MiniMarathonResults.asp">Indianapolis
     half marathon</a> in a personal record time of 14:57 per mile.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >After setting up my new subwoofer, I put in the <a
     href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/">Return of the King</a> DVD and
     zoomed ahead to the Minas Tirith battle scenes.&nbsp; Seconds later, my younger
     daughter ran upstairs and cried, "Daddy, your movie is shaking the whole
     house!"</li>
</ol>

<p>All three of these were moments of great personal
satisfaction.&nbsp; The third one was the only one to result in maniacal laughter.</p>
