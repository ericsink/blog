<p>The Arizona .NET User's Group has one really big <a
href="http://azgroups.com/forums/post/489.aspx">meeting</a> every year, and
I've been invited to come out and speak for this year's event.&nbsp; It will be held
all day Wednesday September 6th at the Orpheum Theater in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

<p>I'll be on stage in the morning with the following two presentations:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >"Really Great Mistakes Made by Well-Intentioned and
     Otherwise Clueful People While Trying to Use Version Control"<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >"Remarkable Blunders Executed by Otherwise Intelligent
     Software Marketing People Who Really Do Mean Well but Somehow Keep Fouling
     Everything Up by Repeating the Same Mistakes Over and Over"</li>
</ul>

<p>I keep thinking maybe these titles are a <i>bit</i> long, so
perhaps I'll try to tighten them up a bit between now and September 6<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp;
Or maybe not.</p>

<p>I'm the opening act.&nbsp; The <s>headline band</s> afternoon
speaker will be <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> who
is a General Manager in Microsoft's Developer Division.&nbsp; Scott oversees a whole
bunch of groups, including ASP.NET, Windows Forms, IIS and the CLR.</p>

<p>Except for the $7 parking fee and the fact that you have to
listen to me in order to hear Scott Guthrie, the event is free of charge.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
