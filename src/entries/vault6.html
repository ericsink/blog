<p>Congratulations to the Vault team here at SourceGear on the release of <a href="http://sourcegear.com/vault/documentation/Vault6featureoutline.html">version 6.0</a>.</p> 

<p>So much in the version control world has changed since it was
first released almost 10 years ago, but Vault remains popular as the best
replacement for SourceSafe.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
