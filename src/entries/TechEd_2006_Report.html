<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >First of all, I would like to publicly apologize for the
     bad attitude I have had about the city of Boston.&nbsp; I was dreading this
     trip.&nbsp; My previous visits to Boston have left me with hatred and
     bitterness.&nbsp; I see now that this is because in the past I have always
     rented a car.&nbsp; This time, I did not, and I experienced a great change of
     heart about this amazing city:<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li >I still think that visiting Boston is an indescribably
      hideous experience for someone driving a car.&nbsp; If your religious beliefs
      include the concept of a place of never-ending torment, think of it like
      this:&nbsp; People who get sent to hell should spend a week driving in Boston first.&nbsp; That way, the rest of eternity won't seem nearly so bad.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >On the other hand, for people who are walking, Boston is a       <i>wonderful</i> city.&nbsp; The weather this week was essentially perfect.&nbsp;
      The seafood is excellent.&nbsp; The buildings are historic.&nbsp; We saw the Boston
      Public Library and the Old South Church, both of which are stunning.&nbsp; The
      people in Boston are friendly and they speak with a cool accent.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li >Bottom line:&nbsp; If you visit Boston, don't make the mistake
      I have made in the past.&nbsp; Hail a taxi.&nbsp; Use public transportation.&nbsp; Walk
      as much as you can.&nbsp; Leave the driving to the local professionals who
      know what they're doing.&nbsp; As long as you don't touch a steering wheel, Boston is a great place to visit.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <li >I was scheduled to arrive at my hotel very late Sunday
     night.&nbsp; Even though my reservation was guaranteed with a credit card, I
     was worried they would give my room away.&nbsp; I've had hotels do that to me
     before.&nbsp; The only suitable punishment for that crime is a lifetime of
     driving in Boston.&nbsp; So I called the hotel Sunday morning and reminded them
     that I would be there late and that I expected my room to be available.&nbsp; I
     told my kids that if the hotel gave my room away I was going to throw the
     biggest tantrum Massachusetts has ever seen.&nbsp; (Only later did I realize
     the sheer scope of my threat:&nbsp; Ted Kennedy is from Massachusetts).&nbsp; Anyway,
     all my worrying was in vain.&nbsp; I arrived around 1am at the <a
     href="http://bostonhotels.jurysdoyle.com/jurys_boston">Jurys hotel</a> and
     got my room as expected.&nbsp; Everything about my stay was quite pleasant.&nbsp; In
     fact, Jurys Boston is one of the nicest hotels I have seen.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >My <a href="/entries/RAZR.html">new
     alarm clock</a> worked really well.&nbsp; Not only does it have an alarm, but
     it has a snooze feature!&nbsp; Oh, and it's also a phone.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li ><a href="http://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> is awesome.&nbsp; We
     deployed it several months ago when we started expanding with presence in
     other cities, but this was my first experience using it on a trip.&nbsp; I am
     very impressed.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >TechEd itself was fine.&nbsp; I didn't go to any of the
     sessions, but the traffic in the expo hall was generally quite active.&nbsp;
     The organizers did a great job this year at driving the attendees to visit
     the exhibitors.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >If you were annoyed at my use of the word "driving" in the
     previous point, then you've probably never been to TechEd.&nbsp; Picture a
     bunch of event staff trying to move twelve thousand geeks around at a
     conference.&nbsp; Now picture cowboys trying to move a herd of cattle.&nbsp; The
     techniques are similar.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b><br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Thanks to the many <s>cows</s> visitors who came to our
     booth.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b>&nbsp; Seriously, talking with people about our product is
     the whole point of a trade show.&nbsp; I particularly appreciated the
     opportunity to meet with a bunch of our existing customers.&nbsp; As a company
     that sells software over the Internet, the chance to meet users in person
     is a rare pleasure.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >It was really funny to see so many people crowded around
     the TV screens to <a
     href="http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,cd3f05d1-bc5d-4bde-8af4-ec5fde9f07ae.aspx">watch</a>
     the World Cup.&nbsp; I'll confess I watched a little, but I just don't get
     soccer.&nbsp; More generally, I'm not a fan of sports which are dominated by
     defense.&nbsp; My boredom threshold is far too low.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >It is always nice to talk with <a
     href="http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/">Julia Lerman</a>, a regular at
     conferences like these.&nbsp; We had a great conversation about WCF.&nbsp; I learned
     some things I didn't know. <br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I had an interesting chat with Ted Bahr of BZ Media.&nbsp; I
     was embarrassed to learn that I had failed to notice that he had written a
     comment on my recent blog <a
     href="/entries/Magazines_Dying.html">post</a> about the death
     of developer magazines.&nbsp; Ted is the 'B' in BZ Media, the publisher of <a
     href="http://www.sdtimes.com/">SD Times</a>.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >An impromptu conversation with <a
     href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> was a lot of fun.&nbsp;
     Actually, I did a lot more listening than talking.&nbsp; Scott talks really
     fast, and he has a lot of very smart things to say.&nbsp; We started talking
     about version control systems and "Tortoise" clients and blame features.&nbsp; At
     some point he started delivering a very passionate sermon about the
     virtues of <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush</a>,
     which somehow looked even more neato with Hanselman preaching than it did
     in the DevExpress booth just down the aisle from us.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I enjoyed a very nice chat with <a
     href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/">Brian Harry</a>, the guy who created
     SourceSafe and who now leads the development of Team Foundation Server.&nbsp; The
     design challenges in building a version control system are <i>incredibly</i>
     hard.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder what it would be like to carry the experience
     from one system while designing an entirely new one.&nbsp; Brian is one of the
     very people on earth who have done this twice, so I seized the chance to
     grill him with a few geeky questions.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I <i>hate</i> the <a
     href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx">decision</a>
     to drop the WinFX name in favor of ".NET Framework 3.0".&nbsp; I stopped by the
     <s>WinFX</s> .NET 3.0 kiosk to say so.&nbsp; They gave me a couple pieces of
     WinFX-branded swag, which I guess are now going to become collector's
     items.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li ><a href="http://ianolsen.wordpress.com/">Ian</a> and I enjoyed
     a pleasant conversation and a game of 8-ball with a couple of guys from <a
     href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate Software</a>, including Simon Galbraith,
     one of their founders.&nbsp; Simon is an interesting guy, and Red Gate is a
     company that I admire very much.&nbsp; BTW, Team SourceGear won that game, but
     just barely.&nbsp; Given that we have a pool table in our office, it was a <i>lot</i>
     closer than it should have been.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b><br>
