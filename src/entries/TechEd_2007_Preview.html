Frankly, I had been wondering if they might just cancel <a

I'm mean really -- without <a

Lerman</a> or <a
href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheTechEdPartyToAttendPartyWithPalermo.aspx">Scott
Hanselman</a>, what's the point?&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Seriously, Tech-Ed starts in just six days, and I am very
much looking forward to this show.&nbsp; It's going to be a big week for SourceGear.</p>

<p>If you'll be there, stop by our booth and say hello.</p>
