<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >On March 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>, SourceGear
     product sales were 61% lower than the average sales for the rest of
     March.&nbsp; Is it just a coincidence that the first round of the NCAA
     basketball tournament was televised during those days?&nbsp; I think not.</li>
 <li >Friday evening I saw my book on the shelf at Barnes and
     Noble here in Champaign.&nbsp; Like most highly anticipated events, the moment
     was rather anticlimactic.&nbsp; It didn't make sense to buy it.&nbsp; So I left.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></li>
 <li >Amazon.com tries really hard to customize itself for me,
     but the harder it tries, the more obvious it is when it falls short:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li >It constantly offers me Rachael Ray's latest cookbook.&nbsp; I
      have purchased exactly one Rachael Ray cookbook in my life.&nbsp; I bought it
      during the month of December (the same month where Christmas usually
      falls).&nbsp; I bought it through my sister's Amazon wish list.&nbsp; There are
      clues here.&nbsp; Amazon should be able to figure out that my interest in
      Rachael Ray cookbooks is exactly the same as my interest in Harlequin
      romance novels.</li>
  <li >When I'm looking at the page for <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596234/sawdust08-20">my own
      book</a>, Amazon can't connect the dots.&nbsp; It knows my name.&nbsp; It knows the
      name of the author of the book currently on my screen.&nbsp; But it doesn't
      ask me if I'm the same person.&nbsp; Becoming an Author has confirmed for me
      that much of the mystique of writing a book is silly.&nbsp; When I finish this
      blog entry I'm going to walk across the street and get some coffee.&nbsp;
      Nobody in the coffee shop will be able to tell that I've written a book.&nbsp;
      In fact, the only person or thing on this planet which <i>should</i> be
      able to recognize me as an author is Amazon, but it won't do it.&nbsp; I'm not
      expecting people in the coffee shop to be in awe of me, but a little mock
      reverence from this stupid overgrown Perl script would seem quite
      appropriate.</li>
 </ul>
 <li >SourceGear Vault was one of the first shrinkwrap products
     built with C# and Windows Forms.&nbsp; We were very early adopters.&nbsp; Just four
     years later, it feels strange to say that we're sticking with these "tried
     and true" technologies even though newer stuff is on the horizon.&nbsp; It just
     won't make sense to <a
     href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">rewrite</a>
     Vault with WPF just to make everything prettier.&nbsp; Still, being an early
     adopter is fun.&nbsp; Over the weekend I bought a PC and installed Windows
     Vista build 5308.&nbsp; Aero Glass looks <i>really</i> nice.</li>
 <li >Time for some coffee...</li>
</ul>
