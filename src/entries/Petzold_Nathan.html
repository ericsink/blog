<p>Last week, Jeff Atwood <a
href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000846.html">blogged</a> about
two WPF books:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619573/sawdust08-20">Applications
     = Code + Markup</a> by Charles Petzold</li>
 <li ><a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672328917/sawdust08-20">Windows
     Presentation Foundation Unleashed</a> by Adam Nathan</li>
</ul>

<p>Atwood likes the Nathan book a <i>lot</i> more than the
Petzold book:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><i>The difference in approach is
immediately obvious to anyone who opens both books. One looks compelling, fun,
and inviting; the other looks like a painful, textbook slog that's the
equivalent of writing code in Notepad. <b>Petzold's an excellent writer, but
writing alone can't make up for the massive layout deficiencies of his book</b>.</i></p>

<p>I am writing this blog entry to throw in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_two_cents_(idiom)">my two cents</a> on
behalf of Petzold's book and his writing style.</p>

<p>But first let me say that I like "Windows Presentation
Foundation Unleashed" very much.&nbsp; It's an extraordinary book.&nbsp; Nothing I say
here should be interpreted as a criticism of Adam Nathan or his work.</p>

<h3>Deep Understanding</h3>

<p>I see the market for developer books following the same path
as the market for developer tools:&nbsp; There is an increasing priority on "quick
results".</p>

<p>Modern development environments like Visual Studio include
many features which are specifically designed to improve developer productivity:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Syntax coloring helps us read our code faster as we write
     it.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >Red and blue squiggly lines draw our eye to errors so we
     can fix them faster.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >IntelliSense spares us from having to remember how to
     spell method names.</li>
</ul>

<p>These features work!&nbsp; As I noted last week, it is amazing
how quickly we can get <a href="/entries/Raw_Code.html">raw
code</a> working with Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I am as addicted to IntelliSense as the next guy.&nbsp; But I do
believe this stuff come with a tradeoff.&nbsp; To some extent, the increasing
emphasis on getting quick results comes at the expense of "deep understanding".&nbsp;
</p>

<p>I define deep understanding as the knowledge of how stuff
works "under the hood".&nbsp; For example:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Deep understanding is knowing how WPF's dependency
     properties work and why they are necessary, not just how to use them.</li>
 <li >Deep understanding is knowing that WPF is built on DirectX
     instead of on GDI, and what that means.</li>
 <li >Deep understanding is knowing why WPF animation is easier
     to use from XAML than it is from C#.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that deep understanding is still very important.&nbsp; Today's
frameworks and libraries are providing some very level high abstractions.&nbsp; This
is good.&nbsp; It helps us work faster.&nbsp; But even well-designed APIs are not
perfect.&nbsp; Sometimes an abstraction layer covers up a problem that is happening
at a lower level.&nbsp; Now you're in trouble, but you can't see why.&nbsp; (Joel Spolsky
refers to this as a <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky
abstraction</a>.)&nbsp; Deep understanding helps you get you out of this mess.</p>

<p>Basic API knowledge will help you write raw code and get
quick results.&nbsp; Deep understanding will help you get out of trouble. &nbsp;When I
hire a software developer, I look for deep understanding.</p>

<h3>Petzold's Books</h3>

<p>I would characterize Petzold as a writer whose primary goal
is to help his readers gain deep understanding.&nbsp; Grab a Petzold book and take
the time to actually <i>read</i> it.&nbsp; It may surprise you how much you learn.</p>

<p>Charles Petzold is currently writing a <a
href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2007/02/050710.html">book on WPF 3D</a>.&nbsp;
I am helping him as a proofreader (without compensation -- there is no conflict
of interest here).&nbsp; I recently sent back one of his chapters with my usual list
of typos and minor edits.&nbsp; He responded and said, "Fine, but did you <i>learn</i>
anything?"</p>

<p>What an excellent question!&nbsp; In fact, I <i>did</i> learn
something by reading that chapter, and this is evidence to the quality of the
content.&nbsp; I am an experienced user of WPF 3D, but when I took the time to
carefully read his material, I still found it very educational.</p>

<p>(And BTW, for those of you who wish that Petzold's first WPF
book contained more figures and illustrations, do take a look at his 3D book
when it comes out.&nbsp; It looks to me like it will have a <i>lot</i> of pictures
illustrating the concepts.)</p>

<p>For the disciplined and patient software developer who wants
deep understanding, Petzold's books are still the way to go.&nbsp; The fact that
such developers seem to be the minority today is a problem with our industry.&nbsp; I
like quick results, but if we continue to sow less and less deep understanding,
we will end up reaping a lot of problems.</p>

<h3>Rude Preemptive Responses to Comments</h3>

<p><i>"How dare you say that Adam Nathan's book offers nothing
more than a shallow coverage of the topic and inhibits deep understanding?!?"</i></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>RTFBE.&nbsp; I didn't say that.</p>

<p><i>"How dare you say that it's impossible to write for deep
understanding and still have a pleasing visual layout?!?"</i></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>RTFBE.&nbsp; I didn't say that.</p>

<p><i>"How dare you suggest that most of today's developers are
too undisciplined and impatient?!?"</i></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>RTFBE.&nbsp; I didn't say that.</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Oh, wait.&nbsp; I guess I <i>did</i> say
that.</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Either way, I think it's true, but
that doesn't <i>automatically</i> mean that the blame falls where you might
think.&nbsp; Here's your homework assignment:&nbsp; If you would agree that many of
today's developers are undisciplined and impatient, spend 5 minutes thinking
about <i>why </i>they are the way they are.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
