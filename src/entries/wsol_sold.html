<h2>The news</h2>

<p>I have sold <a href="http://www.winnablesolitaire.com/">Winnable
Solitaire</a> to Dennis Cronin, the guy behind <a href="http://freecell.com/">freecell.com</a>.&nbsp;
I'm not sure Denny wants me to disclose the price, but I can say that it was a small
number (4 digits) and that I have donated all of it to the Red Cross for
Katrina relief.</p>

<h2>The details</h2>

<p>In September 2004 I wrote an <a
href="http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Micro_ISV.html">article</a> wherein I
coined the term "micro-ISV" and launched a fun little hobby business around a
game I wrote called Winnable Solitaire. &nbsp;My primary goal was to write a good
article, and on that point I think I succeeded.&nbsp; My secondary goal was to make
some money selling an "indie" game.&nbsp; That part didn't go <i>quite</i> so well.&nbsp;
<b>:-)</b>&nbsp; It is now 15 months later.&nbsp; My total sales are approximately $215.</p>

<p>I've got lots of ideas for how to pursue Winnable Solitaire,
but the simple truth is that I don't have time.&nbsp; I never planned for this to be
anything more than a hobby.&nbsp; My day job keeps me plenty busy.</p>

<p>So I have taken the opportunity to sell the whole thing.&nbsp;
Dennis Cronin now has the source code to the solver and the game itself.&nbsp; He is
also getting the domain names (winnablesolitaire.com/org/net).&nbsp; I'm pretty sure
Denny plans to approach this game differently than I did, but I don't know the
details.&nbsp; His freecell.com site is already a functioning business for him and
he seems to have some specific ideas for how Winnable Solitaire is going to fit
into that picture.</p>

<p>I was actually considering an eBay auction when Dennis
called me several weeks ago and expressed an interest.&nbsp; He offered to buy.&nbsp; I
accepted.&nbsp; Reconnecting with Dennis was actually a "blast from the past" for
me.&nbsp; He and I worked together briefly when I was at Spyglass.</p>

<p>Anyway, this brings closure to my involvement with Winnable
Solitaire.&nbsp; I remain fascinated by the concept of a micro-ISV.&nbsp; I still have a
great deal of admiration (and a little envy) for those who have been successful
with this model.&nbsp; Perhaps in a later season of my life I will give the
micro-ISV concept a more serious try.&nbsp; But right now I'm having a ball here at
SourceGear.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Yep, I actually <i>like</i> building version control software.)</p>
