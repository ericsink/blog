<p>Do you work as part of a software team?&nbsp; Here's a piece of
advice for you:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Read
the diffs.</span></b></p>

<p>Every morning before you start your own coding tasks, use <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">your favorite diff tool</a> to look
at all the changes that everybody else checked in the day before.</p>

<p>There is a reasonable chance that this advice is worth
exactly how much you paid me for it.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Still, many of the best developers I have known do make this
their habit.</p>

<p>Reading the diffs is very likely to produce two benefits:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li ><b>The code might get better.</b>&nbsp; Reading the diffs is
     like an informal code review.&nbsp; You might find something that needs to be
     fixed.</li>
 <li ><b>You might learn something.</b>&nbsp; Maybe one of your
     coworkers is using a technique you don't know about.&nbsp; Or maybe reading the
     diffs simply gives you a deeper understanding of the project you are
     working on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, use some common sense about whether this habit is
practical in your situation.&nbsp; For example, if you work on a team of a thousand
developers, this probably won't work well for you.&nbsp; Then again, I assume if you
work on a team of a thousand developers, almost nothing works well for you, so
this habit might fit right in.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
