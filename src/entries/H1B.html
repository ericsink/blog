<p>Until the end of September 2006, we had a person on our team
here at SourceGear.&nbsp; Let's call her Jane.</p>

<p>Jane was an <i>extraordinary</i> employee.&nbsp; She worked in QA
as part of the Vault development team.&nbsp; Her coworkers described her in very
positive ways, sometimes using superlatives.</p>

<p>So what happened -- did she leave SourceGear for a better
job?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; In fact, Jane isn't working at all right now.</p>

<p>Jane is from India.&nbsp; She was working for SourceGear on a J-2
visa, which is basically "the spouse of someone with a J-1 visa".&nbsp;
Unfortunately, her husband's visa changed from J-1 to H-1B (which happened
because he works for the University, which is exempt from the H-1B limits).&nbsp; The
spouse of a J-1 is allowed to work.&nbsp; The spouse of an H-1B is not.</p>

<p>We've been told that the only way for us to rehire Jane is
to get her an H-1B visa of her own.&nbsp; The deadline for submitting applications
was Monday.&nbsp; For uninteresting reasons beyond our control, we didn't even
submit an application.&nbsp; And if we had, there is apparently a good chance we
would have been denied anyway.&nbsp; Only 65,000 slots are available and the
government received <a
href="http://politics.slashdot.org/politics/07/04/03/234201.shtml">150,000
applications</a>.&nbsp; A lottery will be used to decide whose applications are to
be accepted.</p>

<p>I know the H-1B issue is controversial.&nbsp; Public discussion
of the topic tends to include emotionally charged phrases like "indentured
servitude" and "taking jobs from Americans".&nbsp; I don't really know the
subtleties of this debate, nor do I care.&nbsp; Jane wants to work for SourceGear.&nbsp;
SourceGear wants to rehire Jane.&nbsp; None of this has anything to do with saving
money by hiring cheap foreign labor into a life of bondage.&nbsp; When we originally
hired Jane, she was selected from a pool of over 30 applicants.&nbsp; The fact that
she is not a U.S. citizen was irrelevant.&nbsp; She was paid a fair salary and
bonuses according to the same structure as every other member of our team.&nbsp;
Everything was completely legal, and she turned out to be an outstanding hire.</p>

<p>We lost her because of a stupid technicality.</p>

<p>I don't think this is how it's supposed to work.</p>
