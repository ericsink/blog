 <li >We're publishing <a
     href="http://download-us.sourcegear.com/Veracity/nightly/index.html">nightly
     snapshots</a> of Veracity now.&nbsp; These are just one way for a particularly
     motivated/interested person to keep current with our development of
     Veracity.&nbsp; Each night, if the test suite passes, the snapshot gets
     published.<br>
     <br>

 <li >I recently appeared as a guest on <a
     href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=250">Hanselminutes</a>
     (thanks Scott!) talking about DVCS.&nbsp; Podcasts are fun.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I'll be speaking at the <a
     href="http://businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software</a> conference
     next month in Boston.&nbsp; This conference is always a great event.&nbsp; And Boston is a great city to visit for anybody who is not behind the wheel of a car.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Check out <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/1284712.html">this
     post</a> from jwz.&nbsp; Mostly I noticed this because he said the same thing
     about the iPad that I did, and since jwz is, like, a Geek Deity, my cred
     automatically goes up.&nbsp; But I also noticed the term "store and forward" by
     somebody in his comments.&nbsp; That's a phrase I hadn't heard in a while.&nbsp;
     Sounds kind of like a DVCS...<br>

 <li >Joe Duffy's recent blog post on <a
     href="http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2010/09/06/ThePrematureOptimizationIsEvilMyth.aspx">optimization</a>
     is superb.&nbsp; Squeezing more and more performance out of Veracity is a
     primary activity for me lately, and Duffy's post resonates with me a lot.</li>
