<p>I take pleasure in announcing that project Allerton is
growing up.&nbsp; No longer just a "project" with a weird code-name, Allerton has
become a company.&nbsp; We call it <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a>.
</p>

<p>We have decided to keep our VSTS products separate from
SourceGear and give them their own business identity.&nbsp; Teamprise is owned by
SourceGear, but is in many ways quite separate.&nbsp; One of those ways is that I
don't have much involvement with it at all, so I can't promise how much blog
coverage you'll see here on Teamprise or VSTS.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I am close enough to have a good view of the
action.&nbsp; We are out here in Los Angeles for the PDC.&nbsp; In a couple hours or so,
the exhibit hall floor will open and people will see a brand new Teamprise
booth staffed by people wearing very cool Teamprise shirts (which have never
been worn before) and carrying nifty new Teamprise business cards (the ink on
which is barely dry) and showing great Teamprise demos (on hardware that was <a href="/entries/teched_07jun2005.html">NOT</a>
shipped in our luggage).</p>
