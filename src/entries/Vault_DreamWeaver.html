<p>Many developers believe that localization is merely a matter
of language translation.&nbsp; I prefer to think of localization more generally as
the process of making a product <i>appropriate</i> for the expectations of a
given culture.&nbsp; Language is only one aspect of this process.&nbsp; In most cases,
there are other issues to consider.&nbsp; For example:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >If you want to make your sports-related software
     appropriate for Argentina, you have to do more than just translate all the
     strings into their variant of Spanish.&nbsp; You can probably remove the
     features for "American football", and you have to add support for rugby.</li>
 <li >If you want your cell phone software to be appropriate for
     France, you can't just translate everything into French.&nbsp; If you've only
     been supporting CDMA, you also have to make sure it works on GSM.</li>
 <li >Likewise, when we decided we wanted to make our version
     control software appropriate for Dreamweaver users, we knew it wasn't
     enough to just talk more about CSS and less about C#.&nbsp; We had to provide
     good integration into the Dreamweaver environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that is what we did.&nbsp; Vault 3.5 (which is scheduled to
be released in June) will include a plugin which supports <a
href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a> integration.&nbsp;
This is our first effort at localizing Vault for a foreign culture.&nbsp; It is both
exciting and scary to reach out to a group of people who are so different from
us.</p>

<p>Standing at the threshold of this new experience, I find
myself thinking it might have been easier if we had selected a culture more
similar to our own.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I saw a National Geographic TV special
about Dreamweaver users.&nbsp; What an eye-opener that was!&nbsp; Some of the language
and customs of the people in the (former) Republic of Macromedia can seem
really bizarre to a Visual Studio guy like me.</p>

<p>Anyway, we do enjoy a challenge. &nbsp;I am looking forward to
the things I may learn from this new cross-cultural experience.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using Vault with Dreamweaver, the
feature exists as a preview in the <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads.html">current release</a> of
Vault, version 3.1.8.&nbsp; A support <a
href="http://support.sourcegear.com/viewforum.php?f=30">forum</a> for this
plugin is also available.</p>
