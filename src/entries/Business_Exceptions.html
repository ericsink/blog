<p>I'm going to the Rose Bowl.</p>

<p>I am a University of Illinois alum and an avid fan of college
sports.&nbsp; The Illini football team had a great season this year and will play
USC in Pasadena on January 1st.&nbsp; In fact, this is the just the second time in
my lifetime that Illinois has made it to the Rose Bowl.&nbsp; For those of us here
in central Illinois, this is a really big deal.&nbsp; Who knows when it will happen
again?</p>

<p>So last week when the University started selling tickets, I
placed my order.&nbsp; A few days later I received confirmation that I was going to
actually get the tickets I had requested.&nbsp; That email said:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><i>"tickets will be shipped to the
address listed above via UPS Overnight Delivery"</i></p>

<p>I laughed out loud.&nbsp; UPS Overnight?&nbsp; I live right here in
Champaign-Urbana.&nbsp; The University of Illinois Athletic Ticket Office is less
than two miles from my office.&nbsp; Surely I could just go over during my lunch
hour and pick them up?</p>

<p>No, I suppose not.&nbsp; These folks are trying to process orders
for over 25,000 tickets and they have very little time to do it.&nbsp; They probably
just want to have one standard method of handling them all.&nbsp; Dealing with the
special cases would slow everything down.</p>

<p>The next day I got email from UPS with a tracking number for
my tickets:</p>

<p><img width=345 height=196 src="/scm/1734_image001.jpg"></p>

<p>Sure enough -- my tickets were being sent 1.8 miles by "Next
Day Air". &nbsp;At this point, I fully expected that this envelope would be
traveling across town by way of O'Hare.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, UPS actually figured out that it was
already in its destination city:</p>

<p><img width=454 height=288 src="/scm/1734_image002.jpg"></p>

<p>So, let's review:&nbsp; Both the University and UPS faced a
situation which was somewhat of an exception to their normal workflow.&nbsp; One of
them treated the exception as a special case.&nbsp; The other one did not.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And in my opinion, both of these organizations did exactly
the right thing.</p>

<p>I think one of the toughest parts of running a business is
dealing with all the exceptions.&nbsp; These things never get much attention at the
genesis of a company.&nbsp; We write our business plan and we try to figure out how
we're going to handle everything from customer issues to staffing issues to
bugs to parking.&nbsp; But then life hands us a diversity of circumstances we never
expected.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >One of your staff needs to have surgery but they've used
     up all their leave days.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Your biggest customer wants you to add a special feature
     that won't be useful to anybody else. <br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >The policy says anybody who purchased on or after June 17<sup>th</sup>
     will get the upgrade for free.&nbsp; The guy who bought at 10:00pm on June 16<sup>th</sup>
     is on the phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the right thing to do is to handle the situation
as a special case, even if doing so takes extra time.</p>

<p>And sometimes, it's best to just shove everything into the
meat grinder and let sausage come out the other side.</p>

<p>But how do we know which approach to use for a given
situation?&nbsp; The issues in play can include fairness, cost, ethics, focus, and
so on.</p>

<p>And when is the time to realize that a certain kind of
exception is happening often enough that it's worth defining a way to handle
it?</p>

<p>I don't have any silver bullet answers for these questions.&nbsp;
In entrepreneurship, there is no substitute for good judgment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Just keep in mind that exceptions <i>are</i> going to
happen, and how we navigate them can be a major definer of our success in
business.&nbsp; Pay attention, and use common sense.</p>
