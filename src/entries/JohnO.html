<p>I tend to think of myself as a reasonably tactful guy.&nbsp; When
I write, I try not to get people completely ticked off at me.&nbsp; It doesn't
always work.</p>

<p>Recently when the Guardian published a heavily-edited
version of my article about why software has bugs, I got lots of "feedback".&nbsp;
Basically, it appears that I got email from everyone in the UK who has ever been frustrated at any software vendor about any bug.&nbsp; All these messages
had three basic things in common:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >There was no evidence to suggest that the person had
     actually read my article.</li>
 <li >The person was very angry.</li>
 <li >The person was convinced that everything was my fault.</li>
</ol>

<p>All I could do was try to respond with some measure of
empathy.</p>

<p>Actually, getting this sort of "hate mail" is kind of nice.&nbsp;
Sort of.</p>

<p>Back at Gnomedex 2003 I had the incredible privilege of
going to the speakers dinner.&nbsp; The table that evening included some really well-known
writers like Tim O'Reilly and John Dvorak.&nbsp; The #1 thing I remember from that
dinner was each of those guys telling stories about their hate mail.&nbsp; I remembering
thinking that I must not be a "real writer" yet, because nobody had ever sent
me a letter with a salutation of "Dear #+&amp;@*#$ idiot".</p>

<p>(I never did figure out why anybody would send TimO that
kind of mail when all his stuff seems so level-headed.&nbsp; But when I heard that
Dvorak gets that sort of mail routinely, somehow the world made more sense.)</p>

<p>Anyway, most of my stuff just doesn't generate a lot of
negative response.</p>

<p>Well, actually, there are two other examples where people
get kind of upset at me:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >In <a href="/bos/Closing_the_Gap_Part_1.html">Closing
     the Gap</a>, I say a few things that <i>might</i> offend Sales Guys.</li>
 <li >In <a href="/bos/Hazards_of_Hiring.html">Hazards
     of Hiring</a>, I say a few things that <i>might</i> offend people with a
     PhD.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to the Guardian thing, these two articles were
responsible for most of my so-called "hate mail".&nbsp; When I get messages like
that, I usually do respond, and I usually try not to get into a big argument.</p>

<p>But the next time somebody emails me about one of these two
issues, I will have new evidence to present in my defense!&nbsp; Several weeks ago,
we hired a sales guy with a PhD!</p>

<p>I am very pleased to welcome John O'Neill to the management
team of our company.&nbsp; John will be serving as CEO of our Teamprise division.&nbsp;
For the time being, he will be focusing primarily on sales.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And yes, John has a PhD.&nbsp; He got his doctorate in chemical
engineering.&nbsp; Please, don't anybody tell John that the primary reason we chose
him was so that I get the people who think I hate PhDs off my back.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>John is also the Editor and Publisher of <a
href="http://www.blackgate.com/">Black Gate</a>, a scifi and fantasy magazine.</p>

<p>So obviously, with a PhD in engineering and a weirdo publishing
business on the side, John's background is fairly typical for sales executives
in the software field.&nbsp; Nothing to see here...&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>For me, the far more interesting thing about John is that he
spent the last 9 years working in the cellular phone division at Motorola.&nbsp;
This means that I finally have somebody who can give me an answer to the
following question which has been bothering me for years:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Why the &amp;*$# doesn't my cell
phone have an alarm clock built in?</p>

<p>I mean, it's not like this would be difficult.&nbsp; The device
already has the ability to make loud noises.&nbsp; And it already has a clock.&nbsp; In
fact, it would be better than the typical travel alarm clock, because it automatically
keeps track of time zone.</p>

<p>In other words, my phone has all the basic capabilities
necessary to be a really excellent travel alarm clock, but it's not, and I want
to know why.</p>

<p>And before I give John a chance to answer, I would like to
preemptively respond to three things he is likely to say:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Don't tell me the phone actually does have that feature
     and I just missed it.&nbsp; I looked through the whole menu system.&nbsp; Any
     feature which requires more than seven clicks to find isn't really there.</li>
 <li >Don't try to tell me that there isn't enough room in the ROM.&nbsp; My phone's display has an animation of a creepy little alien that does pushups in
     full color.&nbsp; Ditch the cartoon and just give me a simple way to tell my
     phone to ring at 6am.</li>
 <li >The fact that my phone is a Sanyo and John worked at
     Motorola is <i>not</i> relevant.&nbsp; John is now my personal representative
     from the cell phone industry, so this whole thing is his fault.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>:-)</b></p>
