title: How would you reach YOU?

<p>Here's a marketing question to think about:&nbsp; How would you
tell YOU about your product?</p>

<p>Awareness is one piece of the marketing puzzle.&nbsp; In fact, it
is quite obviously one of the essential pieces.&nbsp; Nobody can buy your product if
they have never heard of it.</p>

<p>So we marketers do all kinds of stuff to spread the word.&nbsp;
We run ads in magazines.&nbsp; We go to trade shows.&nbsp; We interact with press people
and try to get reviews and articles written about our stuff.</p>

<p>And then we wonder.&nbsp; How many people have heard about our
product?&nbsp; Did everybody hear our message?&nbsp; Did <i>anybody</i> hear our message?</p>

<p>Most marketing people end up convincing themselves that they
do a good job.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; I think our marketing efforts are pretty darn effective.</p>

<p>But <i>every</i> time I go to a trade show, I encounter
someone who has never heard of us.&nbsp; I am delighted to have the opportunity to
talk with them, but I am also distressed.&nbsp; How could this happen?&nbsp; What did we
wrong?&nbsp; How could somebody <i>not</i> know about SourceGear?</p>

<p>I usually end up realizing that remaining ignorant of our
products is a lot easier than I think.&nbsp; In fact, this truth recently hit me
like a ton of bricks without even going to a trade show.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my office chatting with my coworker Jeremy
Sheeley.&nbsp; Jeremy leads the dev team for Vault and Fortress.&nbsp; In the course of
our discussion, I suddenly realized that none of our marketing efforts would
reach Jeremy.&nbsp; He doesn't go to trade shows or conferences.&nbsp; He doesn't read
magazines.&nbsp; He doesn't read blogs.&nbsp; He doesn't go to user group meetings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Jeremy is a decision-maker for the version control tool used
by his team, and nothing we are doing would make him aware of our product.&nbsp; How
many more Jeremies are out there?</p>

<p>Two caveats apply here:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Jeremy isn't in the market for a version control tool.&nbsp; If
     he were looking for products like ours, he might be more likely to find
     us.</li>
 <li >I later realized that it's not really true that <i>none</i>
     of our efforts could ever reach Jeremy.&nbsp; We run ads on Google.&nbsp; Everybody
     uses Google.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still, I think this stuff is worth thinking about.&nbsp; Pretend
that you are a potential customer.</p>

<p>How many of your current marketing efforts would you simply
never see?</p>

<p>How long would it take you to become aware of your own
product?</p>

<p>How would you get your product message to YOU?</p>
