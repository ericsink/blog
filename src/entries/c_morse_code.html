with</a> Joel over Jeff on whether programmers should know C.</p>

<p>This whole debate reminds me of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">amateur radio</a> operators
bickering over whether newbies should be allowed to get a license without
learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse code</a>.</p>

<h3>Morse Code</h3>

<p><i>So Eric, tell us about your experience as an amateur "ham"
radio operator?</i></p>

<p>My call sign is KA9KEF.&nbsp; To get my General class license, I
had to pass a written exam as well as a Morse code test at 13 words per minute.</p>

<p><i>Really, you know Morse code?&nbsp; Nowadays, it's possible to
get a ham radio license with no code at all.&nbsp; </i></p>

<p>Yes, and I think that's outrageous!&nbsp; It's just wrong.</p>

<p><i>Why do you think that?</i></p>

<p>If I had to learn Morse code, then everybody else should
too.</p>

<p><i>So does anybody really need Morse code these days?</i></p>

<p>Well, I suppose not.&nbsp; But don't pester me with facts that distract
from my point.&nbsp; Learning Morse code should be a rite of passage for all hams.&nbsp;
Anybody who got a license without code is not a "real ham".</p>

<p><i>But you -- you are a "real ham".</i></p>

<p>Yep.&nbsp; I passed the Morse code test.&nbsp; 13 wpm.</p>

<p><i>So you're still actively involved in amateur radio?</i></p>

<p>Well, no.</p>

<p><i>Oh.&nbsp; When was the last time you used your ham rig?</i></p>

<p>I suppose it's been a few years.</p>

<p><i>How many years are in "a few"?&nbsp; Maybe five?</i></p>

<p>More like twenty.</p>

<p><i>Twenty years?&nbsp; </i></p>

<p>Twenty-three, actually.</p>

<p><i>And you still have your amateur radio equipment?</i></p>

<p>Well, no.&nbsp; I sold my station a long time ago.</p>

<p><i>OK, let's review.&nbsp; You're a "real ham", even though
everything you know about ham radio is two decades out of date.&nbsp; But the guys
who got a "no code" license and are actively practicing the hobby today,
they're somehow not "real"?</i></p>

<p>That's right.&nbsp; I know Morse code.&nbsp; They don't.</p>

<p><i>So you think all ham radio operators should be required
to learn a basically useless skill simply because you did?</i></p>

<p>Exactly!&nbsp; And don't ask me to get down from my high horse.&nbsp;
I like it up here.</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p>The argument about whether programmers need to know C is
just so similar.</p>

<p>All of the people arguing that C is important are the people
who have already learned it.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that a lot of their argument is
resting on the same foundation as those crotchety old hams:&nbsp; "If I had to learn
C, then everybody else should too."</p>

<p>I am one of those people.&nbsp; Yep, not only am I a Morse code
bigot, I'm a C bigot as well.</p>

<p>I learned C, and I learned it good.&nbsp; I've worked on multiple
significant C projects.&nbsp; I even wrote a C compiler.&nbsp; In C.&nbsp; I think all "real programmers"
know C.</p>

<p>Yep, we C programmers are elitist and proud of it.&nbsp; The view
from up here on our high horse is pretty good.&nbsp; We see lots of so-called
programmers down there:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >They don't really know what a pointer is.</li>
 <li >They're not even using a real compiler!&nbsp; That thing
     they're using doesn't even generate native code you know.&nbsp; It's "byte
     code", so it's not real.</li>
 <li >Those people have never had to manage their own memory.</li>
 <li >In fact, they've never really had to do anything at all.&nbsp;
     I mean really.&nbsp; They're building on a class library that's got more
     features in it than Photoshop.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are different.&nbsp; We learned C.&nbsp; We are "real programmers".</p>

<h3>One big difference</h3>

<p>What's the main difference between hams who know Morse code
and programmers know C?</p>

<p>The C programmers actually have a point.</p>

<p>Seriously, strip away all the elitism and see what's left.&nbsp; Morse
code is nearly useless, but C is still darn important whether you're using it
or not.</p>

<p>And a lot of people are still using it, by the way.&nbsp; Don't
think of C as merely "important historical and foundational background".&nbsp; In
fact, my current project is being written in C.&nbsp; Software development today is
a big field.&nbsp; There are still many problems for which C is the best solution.</p>

<p>But even if you're coding in something higher level, the
experience of using low-level programming techniques is invaluable.</p>

<p>I'm not going to take a black-and-white stance on this.&nbsp; I
won't go so far as to say that every developer must learn C.&nbsp; I've met lots of
developers without C experience who are successful and making positive
contributions to important software projects.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I'll admit that knowing C is not a magic
solution to poor skills.&nbsp; A lousy developer who happens to know C is simply
better equipped to hurt himself or somebody nearby.</p>

<p>However, I can say these two things:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >All of the truly extraordinary developer s I know are
     people who really understand the kind of low-level details that C forces
     you to know.</li>
 <li >Every programmer without C experience has a clear path of
     personal development:&nbsp; Learn C.&nbsp; Get some real experience using C to write
     a serious piece of software.&nbsp; Even if you never use it again, you'll be a
     better programmer when you're done.</li>
</ol>
