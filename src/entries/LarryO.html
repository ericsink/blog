<p>Wow.&nbsp; Larry O'Brien <a
href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,ce856f5b-ed1c-404d-847f-123d9d2843ba.aspx">posted</a>
his blog's Technorati rank today and I was quite surprised that his blog is not
more popular than it is.&nbsp; Obviously a lot of people are missing out on a blog
that has become one of my favorites.&nbsp; I've only been reading Larry's blog for a
few months, but he seems like one of those rare folks who really understand
both technology and business at a deep level.</p>

<p>Several of his recent posts have been on the topic of <a
href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,753006f4-48d0-4afe-ae1c-a96d96875cf8.aspx">concurrency
and the manycore era</a>.&nbsp; He's really got me thinking lately about how big of
a <a
href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,887e8cb5-9cc7-4012-aef2-ebaec244bb7c.aspx">paradigm
shift</a> we're going to see over the next decade.&nbsp; Single-core CPUs have been
getting faster for so long that we just take it for granted.&nbsp; Larry's right.&nbsp;
There is a huge impedance mismatch between tomorrow's manycore CPU and today's
mainstream programming languages, operating systems and tools.&nbsp; Not too far in
the future, people are going to order a Dell and get a machine with a 16-core
CPU.&nbsp; Most of us are writing code that will only utilize 1/16<sup>th</sup> of
that chip.&nbsp; Most of us don't know <i>how</i> to write software that can
effectively utilize 16 cores.</p>

<p>I've also been seeing a bunch of recent <a
href="http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2006/08/16/why-erlang-is-a-great-language-for-concurrent-programming">blog
posts</a> about <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, the tagline for which
should be "When people create a new programming language to implement a really
great new idea, why can't they use a C-style syntax?"&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Seriously, Erlang's notion of concurrency is so simple and
yet so smart.&nbsp; Critical sections and locks and mutexes and synchronization are
really, really <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/articles/Crowd_Test.html">hard</a>.&nbsp;
Erlang eliminates all that crapola by simply prohibiting threads from sharing memory.&nbsp;
The only way two threads can communicate is by sending messages to each other,
with copy semantics applied to any data in the message.&nbsp; (Erlang's term for a
thread is a "process", implying that it's much heavier than a thread when in
fact the exact opposite is true.&nbsp; Erlang's processes are actually very, very
lightweight threads.)</p>

<p>I realize I'm saying nothing new here.&nbsp; Joel Spolsky posted
his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">rant</a>
about map/reduce and functional languages over two weeks ago.&nbsp; Chris Sells
posted <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1635">his
version</a> of this blog entry back in December 2004.&nbsp; Erlang was invented <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_programming_language">19 years ago</a>.</p>

<p>But the fact is that there is still time to prepare for the
many opportunities that are coming in the manycore era.&nbsp; I bet some of those
opportunities are going to be worth a lot of money to somebody.</p>

<p>I normally discourage entrepreneurs from placing bets on
major industry changes.&nbsp; The desire to work on things that are innovative and
revolutionary arises from an unrealistic and glamorized concept of
entrepreneurship.&nbsp; The next wave is exciting, but there is plenty of money on
the current wave.&nbsp; In fact, there's a shocking amount of money to be made still
working <a href="http://www.microfocus.com/">on the previous wave</a>.</p>

<p>But for me, this particular paradigm shift inspires
confidence.&nbsp; So, to all you would-be entrepreneurs who are always wanting to
ride the next wave, start thinking about how mainstream programmers are going
to create apps which effectively use CPUs with lots of cores.</p>

<p>And start reading Larry O'Brien's <a
href="http://knowing.net/">blog</a>.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
