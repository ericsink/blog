<p>Our Teamprise division has an opening for a software
developer.&nbsp; The <a
href="http://www.teamprise.com/news/2006/05/now_hiring_software_developer.html">official
word</a> is on the Teamprise website, but Ed Thomson's <a
href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/2006/05/why_you_should_work_for_teampr.html">blog
entry</a> is a better read.</p>

<p>BTW, we didn't pay Ed to say those nice things about the
company's owners.</p>

<p>Oh, wait -- actually I guess we did.</p>

<p>But the point is Ed gets paid the same whether we are idiots
or not.</p>

<p>Wait, that didn't come out quite right.</p>

<p>Anyway, you know what I mean...</p>
