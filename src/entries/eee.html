<p>OK.&nbsp; Before I explain why Asus deserves to be mentioned in
marketing textbooks for its horrible management of the Eee brand, let me first
say that I love my <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BYB61G/sawdust08-20">Eee PC
901</a>.&nbsp; I've had this little device for a couple weeks now, and it's just a
really great product.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The battery life is outstanding.</li>
 <li >It takes a few days of use to get accustomed to the
     keyboard, but after that, it's quite usable.</li>
 <li >I wish the Mac were available in this form factor.&nbsp; (Yes,
     I know about the MacBook Air.&nbsp; That's not even close to what the Eee is.)</li>
 <li >I'd prefer Linux, but I've got the XP version.&nbsp; At some
     point, when Ubuntu Netbook Remix is ready to work smoothly on this thing,
     I'll probably repave.&nbsp; But for now, everything Just Works, and I don't
     want to lose that.</li>
 <li >I got this device to replace my day timer, not my laptop.&nbsp;
     I don't really do any serious work on my Eee.&nbsp; It's a portable web browser
     and email client.&nbsp; Visual Studio is not installed.</li>
 <li >OTOH, I'm thinking that for my next trip, the MacBook Pro
     will stay home and the Eee will go.</li>
 <li >I know the 10-inch netbooks are gaining in popularity, but
     for me the 8.9-inch form factor is much better.&nbsp; The MSI Wind is a lot
     bigger.&nbsp; The Eee is so small I can (and do) take it everywhere.&nbsp; The
     10-inch models remind me of a laptop.</li>
 <li >For me, the Eee is the second coming of my HP 200LX.</li>
 <li >I think of my Eee as a large and extremely capable
     BlackBerry, not as a small and a lame laptop.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, like I said, it's a great product.&nbsp; But Asus is doing
everything they can to destroy this brand.</p>

<p>The brand name "Eee" is great.&nbsp; It's short and memorable.&nbsp;
Its sound matches its sense.&nbsp; It just fits.</p>

<p>But Asus is now introducing so many products under the Eee name
that soon the brand will be meaningless.</p>

<p>I believe the first popular Eee was the 701.&nbsp; People raved
about it.&nbsp; I never owned one, but apparently the two most popular attributes
were the low price and the small size.&nbsp; Either of these attributes could have
become the positioning for the Eee brand.&nbsp; Maybe both.</p>

<p>But now Asus has all kinds of Eee products.&nbsp; Some are
small.&nbsp; Some are large.&nbsp; Some are cheap.&nbsp; Some are expensive.&nbsp; They're even
working on a desktop machine with the Eee brand.&nbsp; After that I can only assume
that we'll see Eee cola, Eee furniture and Eee shaving products.</p>

<p>Maybe Asus doesn't care.&nbsp; After all, they're basically a
manufacturing company, not a marketing company, right?&nbsp; The fact that they
created a great brand was probably an accident anyway.</p>

<p>But as a marketer, that's what makes this even more
infuriating.&nbsp; Creating a great brand usually requires hard work, lots of
creativity, and tremendous discipline.&nbsp; When someone pursues the goal in that
manner and succeeds, I admire them.&nbsp; But when someone accidentally succeeds, and
then destroys their own work, I just want to bang my head against the desk.&nbsp;
Yes, I know that luck is a factor.&nbsp; I just hate the situations where luck is
the <i>only</i> factor.&nbsp; We're making <i>products</i> here, not Top 40 pop
radio songs.&nbsp; Talent and hard work should count for <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>Oh well.&nbsp; The Eee brand will die and Asus will return to its
former life of making products that normal people have never heard about.</p>

<p>But I think this product category will survive.&nbsp; These
things might even become popular enough to go mainstream.&nbsp; I can only assume
that Dell will end up being the leader in this market segment.</p>

<p>But whatever brand they use for these products, it will never
be as cool as "Eee".</p>
