<p>I'm on vacation.&nbsp; Aside from catching up on chores around
the house, I'm only doing things that are fun.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Saturday we went to the Urbana Sweet Corn Festival.</li>
 <li >Yesterday I put two coats of finish on a project out in my
     woodshop.</li>
 <li >And today I'm going to get somebody in Redmond ticked off
     at me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft's latest user interface platform is called Windows
Presentation Foundation (WPF).&nbsp; One of the points of emphasis for WPF is
aesthetics.&nbsp; Without exception, all of the WPF sample apps from Microsoft are <i>very</i>
attractive.</p>

<p>In fact, many developers are under the impression that WPF
apps are just naturally pretty.&nbsp; They believe that something about the platform
makes the user interface look great, automatically, with no extra effort.</p>

<p>This is not true.</p>

<p>What Microsoft doesn't want you to know is that it <i>is</i>
possible to make ugly applications using WPF.&nbsp; In fact, ugly is not merely
possible -- it's the default.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I posted <a
href="http://sawdust.com/p1/index.html">Preview 1</a> of Sawdust (my hobby
project).&nbsp; The <a href="http://sawdust.com/">Sawdust.com</a> website is mostly
aimed at woodworkers, but if you're interested in WPF, feel free to click over
there and try it out (it's an XBAP).&nbsp; I think you'll agree that it's not going
to win any software beauty contests.</p>

<p>I'm not blaming WPF for the fact that my application is
ugly.&nbsp; I'm just trying to dispel the myth that WPF applications are naturally
easy on the eyes.&nbsp; Just as with any other UI platform, making a nice-looking
app with WPF requires design skills, and I don't have any.&nbsp; Eventually I'll get
some help and make it not so hard to look at.</p>

<p>Microsoft, if by chance Sawdust's homeliness is an
embarrassment for WPF, you can hurry me along. &nbsp;Just send me a graphic
designer.&nbsp; Be sure to poke holes in the shipping crate so they can get plenty
of air during the trip.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
