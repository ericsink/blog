<p>There are two kinds of people:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Those who tend to divide everything into two groups</li>
 <li >Those who do not.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am one of the former.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>There are two kinds of version control tools:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Those where the history is a Line.</li>
 <li >Those where the history is a Directed Acyclic Graph (a
     DAG).</li>
</ol>

<p>Traditional tools (like Subversion and Vault) tend to model
history as a Line.&nbsp; In the DVCS tools (like Git and Mercurial), history is a
DAG.&nbsp; The differences between these two models are rather interesting.</p>

<p>The Line model is tried and true.&nbsp; History is a sequence of
versions, one after the other.</p>

<p><img width=500 height=100 src="/scm/1761_image001.jpg"></p>

<p>To create a new version:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Grab the latest version</li>
 <li >Make some changes to it</li>
 <li >Check it back in</li>
</ol>

<p>People like the Line model for its simplicity.&nbsp; It provides
an unambiguous answer to the question of which version is latest.</p>

<p>But the Line model has one big problem:&nbsp; You can only
checkin a new version if it was based on the latest version.&nbsp; And this kind of
thing happens a lot:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >I grab the latest version.&nbsp; At the time I grabbed it, this
     was version 3.</li>
 <li >I make some changes to it</li>
 <li >While I am doing this, somebody checks in version 4.</li>
 <li >When I go to checkin my changes, I can't, because they are
     not based on the current version.&nbsp; The "baseline" for my changes was
     version 3, because that's what was current when I started.</li>
</ol>

<p><img width=500 height=175 src="/scm/1761_image002.jpg"></p>

<p>The Line model of history won't allow me to create version 5
as shown in the picture.&nbsp; Instead, a Line model SCM tool will require me to
take the changes which were made between version 3 and 4 and apply them to my
version.&nbsp; This operation is usually called a "merge".&nbsp; The result is that my
baseline gets changed from 3 to 4, thus allowing me to checkin.&nbsp; This model is
explained in <a href="/scm/scm_checkins.html">chapter 2</a>
of my SourceControl HOWTO as "edit-merge-commit".</p>

<p>The obvious question is:&nbsp; What would happen if we allowed 5
to be checked in with 3 as its baseline?&nbsp; Our history would no longer be a
Line.&nbsp; Instead it would be a DAG.</p>

<p>And why would we do this?</p>

<p>The major feature of the DAG model for history is that it
doesn't interrupt the developer at the moment they are trying to commit their
work.&nbsp; In this fashion, the DAG is probably a more pure representation of what
happens in a team practicing concurrent development.&nbsp; Version 5 was in fact
based on version 3, so why not just represent that fact?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a darn good reason why not.&nbsp; In
the DAG above, we don't know which version is "the latest".&nbsp; This causes all
kinds of problems:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Suppose we need the changes in version 4 and 5 in order to
     ship our release.&nbsp; Currently we can't have that.&nbsp; There is no version in
     the system that includes both.</li>
 <li >Our build system is configured to always build the latest
     version.&nbsp; What is it supposed to do now?</li>
 <li >Even if we build both 4 and 5, which one is QA supposed to
     test?</li>
 <li >If a developer wants to update her tree to the latest
     version, which one is it?</li>
 <li >When a developer wants to make some changes, which version
     should they use as the baseline?</li>
 <li >Our project manager wants to know which tasks are done and
     how much work is left to do.&nbsp; His notion of "done" is very closely
     associated with the concept of "latest".&nbsp; If he can't figure out which version
     is latest, his brain is likely to just blue screen when he tries to update
     the Gannt chart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yep, this is a bad scene.&nbsp; Civilization as we know it will
probably just shut down.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In order to avoid dogs and cats living together with mass
hysteria, the tools that use a DAG model of history provide a way to resolve
the mess.&nbsp; The answer is the same as it is with Line history.&nbsp; We need a merge.&nbsp;
But instead of requiring the developer to merge before they commit, we allow
that merge to happen later.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=500 height=174
src="/scm/1761_image003.jpg"></p>

<p>Somebody needs to construct a version which contains all the
changes in both version 4 and version 5.&nbsp; When this version gets committed, it
will have arrows pointing to both of its "parents".&nbsp; </p>

<p>Order has been restored.&nbsp; Once again we know which version
is "the latest".&nbsp; If somebody will remember to reboot the project manager, he
will probably realize that this DAG looks almost like a Line.&nbsp; Except for that
weird stuff happening between version 3 and 6, it <i>is</i> a Line.&nbsp; Best not
to lose sleep over it.</p>

<p>What this project manager doesn't know is that this
particular crisis was minor.&nbsp; He thinks that his paradigm has been completely
challenged, but one day he's going to come into his office and find this:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=500 height=353
src="/scm/1761_image004.jpg"></p>

<p>&amp;@#$!</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>If you're living in the Line model paradigm, this DAG is an
absolute disaster.&nbsp; It has FOUR leaf nodes.&nbsp; Everything that needs to know
which version is latest is about to completely fall apart, including the
aforementioned product manager who is probably now in his office curled up in a
fetal position and hoping that Mommy includes cookies with his SpaghettiOs at
lunch.</p>

<p>The Line model is looking pretty good right now.&nbsp; There's a
good reason why 99.44% of developers are using an SCM tool built on the Line
model of history.&nbsp; (Yes, I made that statistic up.)</p>

<p>And yet, despite all this apparent chaos, we should remind
ourselves of the primary benefit of the DAG model:&nbsp; It more accurately
describes the way developers work.&nbsp; It doesn't make developers bend to its will
like the Line model does.&nbsp; When a developer wants to check something in, he
does, and the DAG merely records what happened.</p>

<p>Many teams will always prefer the Line model, and there's
nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; Life is simpler that way.</p>

<p>But for some other teams, the DAG model can be really
valuable.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And for other teams, the DAG model might be coming along simply
because they want to use a DVCS tool for other reasons.&nbsp; DVCS tools use a DAG
because they have to.&nbsp; If we can't assume a live connection to a central
server, there isn't any way to force developers to make everything fit into the
Line model.</p>

<p>So we need to figure out ways of coping with the DAG.&nbsp; How
do we do this?</p>

<p>One way is to reframe every operation.&nbsp; If you tell a doctor
that "it hurts when I need to know which version is latest", the doctor will
tell you to "stop doing that".&nbsp; Instead, always specify exactly which node to
use:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The build machine doesn't build the latest node.&nbsp; Instead,
     it builds whichever node we tell it to build.&nbsp; Or maybe it builds <i>every</i>
     node.</li>
 <li >QA tests whichever build somebody decides they should
     test.</li>
 <li >Developers don't update their tree to "the latest".&nbsp;
     Instead, they look at the DAG, pick a node, and update to that one.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not saying this approach is practical.&nbsp; I am merely
observing that it is conceptually valid.&nbsp; As long as you're willing to specify
which node you want to use, any operation that needs a node can proceed.</p>

<p>But how do we specify a node?&nbsp; One thing that makes this
approach problematic is that these nodes tend to have odd names.&nbsp; For example,
in Git, the name of a node is something like e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391.&nbsp;
Developers are going to find this naming scheme to be a <i>little</i>
unintuitive.</p>

<p>All DVCS tools use a DAG.&nbsp; And all these tools do various
things to either prevent "the crisis of multiple leaf nodes" or to help the
team cope with it.&nbsp; But they all seem to do it a little differently.</p>

<p>Happily, this presents me with an opportunity to divide them
all into two groups:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Those who handle this problem in ways that I like.</li>
 <li >Those who handle this problem in ways that I do <i>not</i>
     like.</li>
</ol>

<p>This blog entry is already longer than I thought it would be,
so I'm going to stop here and continue next week.</p>
