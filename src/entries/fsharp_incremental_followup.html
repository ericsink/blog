<p>So I ruffled a few feathers with my previous post, <a href="/entries/fsharp_incremental.html">Attracting more developers to F#</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the feedback I received was positive, but not all of it, and
I want to continue the conversation a bit further.</p>

<h2>The Big Idea</h2>

<p>For some readers, the big idea of my post got lost due to some clumsy writing on my part.  Here's the main thing I was trying to say, in five points:</p>

<p>(1) In the context of .NET ...</p>
<p>(2) F# usage is being hindered by the perception that adopting F# will be a terribly painful change, and ...</p>
<p>(3) This perception is inaccurate, as it is very possible to approach F# in an incremental and additive way, and ... </p>
<p>(4) To some extent, that will involve using the non-FP features of F#, and ...</p>
<p>(5) That's okay.</p>

<p>I like to think that if my post had contained only the five points above, it might have earned an "Amen" from nearly every F# fan.</p>

<p>However, based on the feedback I received, I now see that my post had some minor problems, and a couple of major ones.</p>

<p>The minor problems mostly came when I tried to illustrate my big idea with somewhat quirky examples.  Perhaps it was a bit contrived to reference the issue about the F# compiler backend.  Perhaps the terminology of "ML dialect" was not the best way to speak about how questions of functional programming might play into the perception of F# as a non-incremental change.</p>

<p>Those things don't bother me too much.  It's rare to write something and never find ways it could have been better.</p>

<p>The main reason for this followup is to address the two problems I see as "major".</p>

<h2>What about JS, Fable, SAFE stack?</h2>

<p>My post doesn't clearly explain where it fits in the F# community as a whole.</p>

<p>F# is a .NET language, but nowadays it is also a JS language.  It targets two (somewhat) distinct platforms.</p>

<p>Point (1) above wasn't clear at all.  Picture a Venn diagram of the F# community and the .NET community.  My post was intended to be applicable only to the area where those two circles overlap.  When I was writing it, I was thinking mostly about .NET Core and Xamarin.</p>

<p>So it (understandably) seemed strange to some readers that a lot of the exciting stuff going on in the F# world right now is with <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a> and <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE</a>, (which, BTW, are obviously awesome), and I didn't mention them.  I should have, if only to provide better context.</p>

<p>Personally, I am extremely interested in the perception and adoption of F# in the .NET community, so that's what I was writing about.</p>

<p>But plenty of F# developers are focusing their attention on other areas, and that's cool too.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Given points (2) and (3) above, the question is "Why?".  

<p>Perhaps I should have left this in the form of a question.
Something like:  "Much of the .NET community has a perception of F# that (I think) is inaccurate.  How did that happen?"</p>

<p>Instead, I tried to proceed with the following sentence as my starting point: "<i>My claim is that we (F# fans) need to examine how we are contributing to the problem.</i>"</p>

<p>Ordinarily, I would have no hesitation about that kind of approach.  Every coin has two sides.  I hold a basic belief that in every disagreement or misunderstanding or conflict, even if it initially seems like I am not at fault, it is profitable to ask myself how I might be "contributing to the problem".</p>

<p>I do think we (F# fans) have choices in how we talk about F# to others.  Our words can help promote accurate perceptions or they can add confusion.</p>

<p>And I do still think maybe I am correct in saying that "<i>The least effective way to promote F# adoption is the one that comes most naturally.</i>"</p>

<p>But my post tackled this issue with far too little awareness and respect for the full history of the F# community.  I am, relatively speaking, a newcomer. In the 14 year history of F#, there have been quite a few ups and downs.  I didn't start with F# until around 2014, so I wasn't there for all of that.</p>

<p>Quite simply, if you have been with F# for a long time, you've been through a lot.  Did my piece seem like I was saying it's your fault that C# developers don't understand F#?  <img src="/smiley.gif"/></p>

<p>If so, I can understand why you saw that.  And, given how complicated the relationship between the F# and .NET communities has been, I can understand why challenging you to examine your level of responsibility would be unwelcome, especially coming from someone with only a few years on the scene.</p>

<p>And I'm sorry.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>I love F#.  I love C#.  I just want us to be a happy .NET family.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for those who took the time to read my post, and to those who gave feedback, both positive and negative.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>But the memes.  Not exactly fresh, but still, the memes were great, right?  <img src="/smiley.gif"/></p>
