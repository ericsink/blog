title: Twitter!  Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!

<p>Last night I saw <a
href="http://sachin.posterous.com/the-finder-is-dead-soon-a-pc-wont-have-files">this
article</a>, which basically says the one day soon computers won't present the
user with the ability to manipulate "files" anymore.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I had stuff to say.&nbsp; But I've been using Twitter,
which limits me to 140 characters.&nbsp; So, I Tweeted this:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><i>We're heading toward two classes
of computers: one for people like me, and one for people like my Mom.</i></p>

<p>(And BTW, Mom, usually when I mention you on the Internet,
I'm not really talking about you.&nbsp; You're a metaphor for "normal people", those
who use computers to get things done, as opposed to geeks like me, who use
computers just because they are shiny.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought the tweet would be enough.&nbsp; It wasn't.</p>

<p>In the beginning, we were the only ones here.&nbsp; Normal people
didn't use computers at all.&nbsp; Only the geeks used computers, and we certainly
weren't using them to get anything done.</p>

<p>I remember my Mom saying that she would never use a
computer.&nbsp; (Mom, this one is actually you.)&nbsp; And I certainly can't blame her
for thinking that at the time.&nbsp; She had no reason to see computers as a way of
getting things done.&nbsp; All she knew is that I would periodically run into the
family room to announce to my parents that I had just shaved three more
instructions out of the main loop so now my graphics move faster.&nbsp; And Mom just
wanted me to at least stack my Byte magazines in the corner so she could get
the vacuum cleaner through.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today.&nbsp; Computers, by and large, are still
designed for geeks.&nbsp; This is why we all buy T-shirts that say "No, I will not
fix your computer".&nbsp; The genius of the iPad is that it cannot get things like
viruses.&nbsp; It is a closed platform.&nbsp; You can't put apps on it.&nbsp; You can't write
and distribute software for it without Apple's permission.&nbsp; This is why geeks
hate it and normal people will love it.</p>

<p>Your Mom wants a computer she doesn't have to ask you to
fix.&nbsp; She is willing to trade power and flexibility to get simplicity.&nbsp; The
iPad is another major step.</p>

<p>I find this interesting because it raises all kinds of
questions:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The industry is finally ready to sell things that make
     geeks feel frustrated instead of things that make normal people feel
     helpless.&nbsp; What does this mean for geeks and our role in society?<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >How is the terminology going to shake out?&nbsp; Surely we need
     two different names?&nbsp; Things that geeks use should probably still be
     called "computers".&nbsp; What should we call the class of devices that help
     normal people manage their Amazon wish list?<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >We geeks will become the minority market niche.&nbsp; How will
     this affect the pricing of things?&nbsp; Will there be sufficient economies of
     scale to sell computers to geeks at margins that are tolerable to both
     buyer and seller?<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >What kinds of computers/devices will get caught in the
     middle and suddenly have no place in the world?<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >What classes of users are going to be special cases?&nbsp; I'm
     talking about folks that are not geeks but that for some other reason
     cannot accept the power/simplicity tradeoff of devices designed for normal
     people.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a major wave of change.&nbsp; I don't know the answers to
these questions.&nbsp; The only thing that seems clear to me is that Microsoft will
miss this wave just like they missed the last one.</p>
