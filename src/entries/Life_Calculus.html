align=right hspace=12>Yesterday my coworkers redecorated my office.&nbsp; Pictures
in this blog entry are photos of their work.&nbsp; Strangely enough, I found myself
quite appreciative of their act of vandalism.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Today is my 40<sup>th</sup> birthday.&nbsp; Like most other days,
I started by walking the dog and making a To-Do list.&nbsp; However, today's list
has a special item:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Decide whether to have a mid-life crisis or not.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>:-)</b></p>

<p>I'll confess I am not entirely thrilled about being 40.&nbsp; It
doesn't seem that long ago that 40 seemed far away.&nbsp; Now that it's here, I
realize that it's not what I expected.&nbsp; I thought my life at 40 would be
different.</p>

<p><img width=120 height=160 src="/scm/1739_image002.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Many who know me would assert that I have nothing to
complain about.&nbsp; And they would be correct.&nbsp; My life has been filled with
blessings of all kinds, for which I am truly thankful.&nbsp; I am a published
author.&nbsp; Most would consider me financially successful.&nbsp; I am in a career where
I enjoy my work.</p>

<p>But still...</p>

<p>As the old saying goes, nobody lies on their deathbed
wishing they had spent more time at the office.</p>

<p>Like most everybody else, when I was 30 I looked ahead ten
years and formed a picture in my mind.&nbsp; My life today doesn't match that
picture very well.&nbsp; Examples:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I thought by now I would be more solid in the quality of
     my relationships with my loved ones and in the practice of my faith.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I thought by now I would be a better guitar player.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >There's a messy pile in my study that has been there for
     ten years.&nbsp; (Yes, we moved six years ago.&nbsp; The heap moved too.)&nbsp; I thought
     it would be cleaned up by now.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I always assumed that by 40 I would have learned to
     exercise regularly and stop eating junk food.</li>
</ul>

<p><img width=160 height=120 src="/scm/1739_image003.jpg"
align=right hspace=12>I go could on.&nbsp; And on.&nbsp; But you get the idea.</p>

<p>I am tempted to think about my regrets, the places where I
took a wrong turn, the places where I would have made a smarter choice if I
knew then what I know now.</p>

<p>But this whole line of thinking doesn't seem at all
conducive to good mental health, so today I will choose to focus on two things
which seem more constructive:</p>

<h3>1.&nbsp; Tapestry</h3>

<p>One of my favorite Star Trek episodes is called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)">Tapestry</a>.&nbsp;
It is the story of someone given a chance to re-live a pivotal moment in his
youth so that he can avoid making the unwise choice he made the first time.&nbsp;
But it turns out that his reckless moment was a critical ingredient in his
later successes.</p>

<p>Today I remind myself that there are no do-overs, and I'm
not sure I would want one anyway.&nbsp; For every mistake I have made, there were negative
consequences and positive lessons.&nbsp; I can't expect to avoid the former and keep
the latter. &nbsp;They come together as an inseparable package.</p>

<h3>2.&nbsp; Life Calculus.</h3>

<p>Back in 2003 I wrote an article called <a
href="/Career_Calculus.html">Career Calculus</a>.&nbsp; In a
nutshell, it says that at any given moment in your career, what you know is far
less important than whether you are learning.</p>

<p>Today I remind myself that the same principle applies in
life.&nbsp; I am confident in my first derivative.&nbsp; Whatever I am today, I think I
will be a better person tomorrow.</p>

<p>So if I'm still blogging when I'm 50, I expect I will be
able to report progress on some of the items mentioned above.</p>

<p>And just to be clear, if that heap of junk on the floor of
my study is still there, it will be larger than it is now, and I plan to report
that as progress.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
