 <li >I just got back from 10 days in Orlando.&nbsp; Isn't the first
     day back from vacation fun?</li>
 <li >On Sunday, my wife Lisa <a

     her first 26.2 mile event at the Disney World Marathon.&nbsp; Congratulations
     to her on an amazing achievement and a big "thank you" to all who have
     supported her <a href="/entries/lisa_marathon.html">charity
     cause</a>.</li>
 <li >I walked the half-marathon race on Saturday.&nbsp; Fun race.&nbsp;
     It starts at Epcot, goes up for a walk through Magic Kingdom, and then
     back to Epcot.&nbsp; This event required a pace of 16 minutes per mile or
     faster.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I completed the event with an overall pace of 15:56,
     which means I wasted the opportunity to loaf for a full four seconds on
     every mile.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></li>
 <li ><a href="http://www.winnablesolitaire.com/">Winnable
     Solitaire</a> has been reborn.&nbsp; Denny Cronin's web version of the game is
     now online.&nbsp; I can't believe how quickly he did this.&nbsp; He just got the
     code 24 days ago.</li>
 <li >On February 1<sup>st</sup>, I will be speaking at the <a
     href="http://www.jaxdug.com/">Jacksonville .NET User Group</a>.&nbsp; I'm not
     quite ready to post my topic/abstract yet, but I plan to do so before the
     meeting.</li>
