<p>So I come in to the office this morning and find out that my
coworker <a href="http://www.benpryor.com/blog/">Ben Pryor</a> is blogging.&nbsp;
Ben's office is about 50 feet away from mine.</p>

<p>I learned of Ben's blog through an <a
href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/buddies/000197.html">entry</a> on Martin
Woodward's blog.&nbsp; Martin is another coworker.&nbsp; His office is about 3,760 miles
away from mine.</p>

<p>Obviously this situation presents me with three
alternatives:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Be annoyed that Martin, in Ireland, always seems to know
     what's going on before I do.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Be happy that Ben is blogging and delighted at how the
     Internet makes the world smaller.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Create a diversion.&nbsp; Shift the attention away from myself
     by publicly asking some other coworker why they aren't blogging yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>I choose option 3. &nbsp;<a

excuse?</p>
