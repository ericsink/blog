<p>(This blatantly off-topic post is a sequel to a <a href="/item_10165.html">similar one</a> that I made approximately one year ago.&nbsp; In general, I confine my postings here to the topic of software and the business thereof.&nbsp; But as I said in my article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software02052005.asp?frame=true">transparency</a>, I occasionally like to include a personal glimpse.)</p>
<p>This weekend I once again walked the <a href="http://www.500festival.com/">half-marathon</a> in Indianapolis.&nbsp; My time was 3 hours, 17 minutes, 35 seconds, an average pace of 15:05 per mile.</p>
<p>This year I had a very interesting experience which was precipitated by two big mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistake #1 -- In training for this race, I never did a walk longer than 4 miles.
</li>
<li>Mistake #2 -- I <em>ran</em> the first mile of the race.&nbsp;
</li>
</ul>
<p>My wife is a runner, but I'm not.&nbsp; Somehow we ended up assigned to the same starting corral, so I decided I would run with her "for just a little while" and then walk the remainder of the race as I had planned.&nbsp; In hindsight, this was Not A Smart Idea.</p>
<p>Running actually felt good, so I kept doing it all the way to the first mile marker where I finally slowed to a walk and let her go on ahead.&nbsp; But I was exhilarated!&nbsp; I'm pretty sure the last time I had run for a mile or more was over a decade ago.&nbsp; What a great way to begin my race!&nbsp; I began to think about how that first mile might help my overall time.</p>
<p>I walked mile 2 in about 15 minutes, a pretty fast pace for me, but it felt slow compared to mile 1.&nbsp; So for miles 3, 4 and 5 I increased my speed to just over 14 minutes per mile.&nbsp; At the 5-mile marker, my average pace was 14:07 per mile.&nbsp; That was when I decided to set a goal.&nbsp; My goal was to complete the race at an average pace of 15 minutes per mile or less.&nbsp; I figured I might need to mix in a little more running later, but the goal seemed very attainable.</p>
<p>But after that, every mile became more difficult.&nbsp; Mile 7 took me over 16 minutes, which means I lost ground against my goal.&nbsp; I decided to make up that ground by walking as fast I could for mile 8, which took place on the Indy 500 track.&nbsp; I felt like I was flying.&nbsp; I passed all kinds of people.&nbsp; I was so certain that I would be under 14 minutes for that mile, but it turned out to be 14:10.&nbsp; I considered grabbing one of the staff and telling them that some idiot put the mile marker in the wrong place, but that would have wasted precious time.</p>
<p>Mile 10 seemed eternal.&nbsp; By the time I reached the 10-mile marker, I was in pain.&nbsp; My overall average was up to 14:42, but I still thought I could make it.&nbsp; I'm a computer programmer.&nbsp; I spend my life on mental challenges.&nbsp; Sheer physical limitations are unfamiliar territory for me.&nbsp; I had only 3.1 miles to go.&nbsp; If necessary, I would just sprint the final stretch into the finish line.</p>
<p>Miles 11 and 12 were simply hellish.&nbsp; Each of them took me over 16 minutes, and I was in agony.&nbsp; People were passing me left and right.&nbsp; A woman who had to be older than my mother walked past me at top speed.&nbsp; I started feeling irrational.&nbsp; I was angry at everyone I could think of.&nbsp; I was certain that the entire situation was somebody else's fault.</p>
<p>As I reached the end of mile 12, somebody walked past me wearing a shirt that said, "Pain is temporary.&nbsp; Pride is forever."&nbsp; That sounded logical.&nbsp; I began to think like a programmer again, and I resolved that I was going to make my goal, no matter what.&nbsp; It was just a matter of sheer will, right?&nbsp; I had to complete the final 1.1 miles in a little over 16 minutes.&nbsp; I ignored the pain in my legs and increased my speed.</p>
<p>And that's when things got really bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final mile, they had markers every quarter-mile.&nbsp; With 3/4 mile to go, I was walking very slowly.&nbsp; I started realizing that I probably would not make my goal.</p>
<p>I was nearing the point of physical exhaustion, but I couldn't understand it.&nbsp; I had visited every single water and Gatorade station along the way.&nbsp; I had consumed one of those awful <a href="http://www.gusports.com/">energy gels</a> every 45 minutes.&nbsp; I <em>wanted</em> to finish strong.&nbsp; I've seen all those Nike commercials.&nbsp; Why couldn't I "Just Do It"?
</p>
<p>With 1/2 mile to go, I felt like I had <em>nothing</em> left.&nbsp; I stopped to rest, for just a few seconds.</p>
<p>With 1/4 mile left, I could hear somebody on the PA system congratulating us for finishing 13.1 miles.&nbsp; I thought about how much I hated that man.&nbsp; My goal wasn't even an issue anymore.&nbsp; My new goal was to simply take each step without falling down onto the pavement.&nbsp; The finish line was in clear view, but I seriously doubted that I was going to finish at all.</p>
<p>But I did finish.&nbsp; I was 65 seconds over my extremely foolish goal, but I was just glad to complete the 13.1 miles.&nbsp; If the race had been 13.2 miles, I'm not sure I would have made it.</p>
<p>Every finisher gets a medal.&nbsp; That medal is now one of my most treasured possessions.&nbsp; I learned something about myself on Saturday.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to express what I learned, but it was something very new, something about my own limitations, limitations that I never have to face in the practice of building software.</p>
