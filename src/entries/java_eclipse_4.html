<p>As a member of Microsoft's <a
href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vsx2008/products/bb964519.aspx">VSIP</a>
program, we have been creating source control plugins for the Visual Studio
line of products for eight years.&nbsp; As I started my recent foray into the
Eclipse world, I was eager to explore the area of plugins over on this side of
the fence.&nbsp; So far, I'm impressed.</p>

<h3>Source Control and Bug Tracking</h3>

<p>The first plugin I installed was our own.&nbsp; SourceGear
Fortress includes an Eclipse plugin, but I had never even tried it.</p>

<p>My first reaction is that I really like the way Eclipse
handles installation of plugins.&nbsp; The whole process is managed from within
Eclipse itself.&nbsp; Under the Help menu is a submenu called Software Updates.&nbsp; All
I have to do is provide the URL of our Eclipse update site:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>http://download.sourcegear.com/Fortress/latest/update</p>

<p>The rest of the job is very simple, essentially automatic.</p>

<p>Once installed, I have several additional views:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=439 height=37
src="/scm/1731_image001.jpg"></p>

<p>And some new stuff under the Team menu:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=392 height=187
src="/scm/1731_image002.jpg"></p>

<p>And some new items under Preferences:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=472 height=161
src="/scm/1731_image003.jpg"></p>

<p>All in all, I have found using source control under Eclipse
to be very pleasant and straightforward.&nbsp; If this seems like I am bragging
about my own product, I suppose it is, except for two mitigating factors:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >I personally had nothing to do with this plugin, so this
     is less of a boast and more of a compliment to the efforts of my
     coworkers.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >In my experience, source control plugins are a lot like
     children.&nbsp; To some extent, the behavior of a child (or plugin) reflects
     the quality of the structure and guidance provided by the parent (or
     IDE).&nbsp; In saying that our source control plugin works very well, I am
     complimenting Eclipse.</li>
</ol>

<p>Truth be told, I did find [what I think is] a bug in our
Eclipse plugin.&nbsp; Fortunately, because Fortress supports integrated
bug-tracking, I was able to use the plugin to report the bug right from within
Eclipse.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<h3>CheckStyle</h3>

<p>In <a href="/entries/java_eclipse_2.html">part
2</a> I complained about the way Java handles object comparison (== is for
identity, .equals() is for state).&nbsp; I received quite a few comments and emails
for that one.&nbsp; I don't mind the contrasting points of view, but I'll confess I
deleted all the remarks from condescending nitwits who assumed I simply don't
understand pointers.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Anyway, several people suggested I try an Eclipse plugin
called <a href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/">CheckStyle</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, installation was extremely simple.&nbsp; After that,
I immediately ran CheckStyle on my code, just to see what happens with no further
configuration.</p>

<p>CheckStyle complained about the 301 places where I put the
curly brace <a href="/entries/java_eclipse_1.html">on the next
line</a>.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Overall, CheckStyle looks very cool.&nbsp; I'll be experimenting
with it more and configuring it to match my coding style.&nbsp; I don't expect I'll
make the == mistake again now that I remember how Java does things, but it's
nice to know that if I do, CheckStyle can pester me about it.</p>

<h3>The Ecosystem</h3>

<p>The VSIP people are always talking about the Visual Studio
"ecosystem", the collection of organizations creating every conceivable type of
plugin for Visual Studio.</p>

<p>The corresponding ecosystem for Eclipse appears to be
enormous.&nbsp; When I Google for the words "eclipse plugin", the top two hits
appear to be sites which are trying to help people find plugins.&nbsp; One of those
sites is <a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/">www.eclipseplugincentral.com</a>,
which seems to be saying there are 991 plugins in its directory.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I know for a fact that there are at least 992, because the
SourceGear Fortress plugin isn't listed yet.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Browsing the directory reveals an incredible diversity of
plugins.&nbsp; Many of them are unsurprising, but the fringe cases suggest just how
large the surface area of this ecosystem really is:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >There's a plugin for editing Wikipedia articles.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >There's a VNC plugin, so I can manage remote machines
     without leaving Eclipse.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >There's a plugin that allows me to play minesweeper within
     Eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, as I looked through this list of plugins, I started
to realize that Eclipse is basically a modern Emacs.&nbsp; The true die-hard Emacs
users want to do <i>everything</i> within Emacs.&nbsp; One of my coworkers likes to
edit /etc/passwd and set emacs to be his shell.&nbsp; Eclipse seems to be heading in
the same direction.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

<p>I've tried 2 Eclipse plugins so far -- 990 to go.&nbsp; This
should be fun.</p>

<p></p>
