<p>I am now managing this weblog with <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/citydesk/">CityDesk</a>.</p>
<p>Most people today are using <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/">.Text</a> or something similar.&nbsp; The peer pressure is severe, but I really wanted a desktop-based solution with a WYSIWIG editor.&nbsp; I have no interest in things like comments or trackback.&nbsp; I just want a good environment for writing and hyperlinking and static HTML output.</p>
<p>I have tried several times to make the switch from my homebrew blogging tool over to CityDesk.&nbsp; In each of my previous attempts, the transition became too painful and I gave up.&nbsp; But this time I have succeeded.&nbsp; It was still a lot of work to get all my content moved over without breaking links.</p>
