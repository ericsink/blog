<p>Congrats to Neil Davidson for putting on an outstanding <a
href="http://www.businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software conference</a>
in San Jose last week.&nbsp; I enjoyed the event very much, especially the
opportunity to meet and chat in person with people I had previously known only
by email.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Highlights from the presentations I attended:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Guy Kawasaki is always a great speaker.</li>
 <li >Bill Buxton offered a very thought-provoking discussion of
     usability.</li>
 <li >Alberto Savoia's gave the most entertaining discussion of
     software metrics I have ever heard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slides from my presentation are <a
href="/downloads/ericsink_marketing_for_geeks_with_notes.ppt">available</a>.&nbsp; This
PowerPoint file contains notes which roughly correspond to what I said at the
event.</p>
