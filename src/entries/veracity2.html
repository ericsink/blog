<p>Last week we released our first public beta of Veracity 2.0 (<a href="http://veracity-scm.com/releasenotes/2.0.html">release notes</a>).  Version 2.0
represents a big step forward in the maturity and performance of
Veracity.</p>

<p>In addition, a big part of what we have built during this release cycle 
is our cloud hosting service for private repositories, <a href="https://onVeracity.com/">onVeracity.com</a>.</p>

<p>All of this continues progress toward our vision for Veracity as
"the DVCS built for business".</p>

<h3>Tell me again how Veracity is different from Git?</h3>

<p>In the last couple of years, Git has become very popular with early adopters
and the open source community.  But most mainstream business users are still on
Subversion or some other centralized tool.
As more and more corporate development teams migrate to the distributed model,
Veracity offers them an alternative.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>In contrast with Git (which was built for Linux) and GitHub (which has
become popular primarily through its social networking features and hosting of
open source projects), 
Veracity was designed from the beginning with a focus on business users.</p></li>

<li><p>On our first day of coding, the Veracity team had one developer on a Mac and
one developer on Windows.  Cross-platform teams have been in Veracity's DNA
from the start.</p></li>

<li><p>Veracity goes beyond version control to provide work items, wiki, build
tracking, and agile features.  And because all of these features are built on the
same decentralized architecture, they are all tightly integrated and
work together seamlessly.</p></li>

<li><p>Veracity's core is open source under the business-friendly Apache License
2.0, not the GPL, which many businesses fear due to its viral nature.</p></li>

<li><p>Veracity performs formal tracking of renames and move, resulting in more
robust merges and confidence that the revision history of a file is complete
even when its path changes.</p></li>

<li><p>Veracity places a very high value on data integrity and immutability.  It provides no features
which allow the developer to alter the history of things that happened in the
past.  Everything committed to the repository is retained forever, with
complete information about what change was made, who made it, and when.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>We've been developing version control solutions for business users since 1998.
Our experience has taught us that these are things that many corporate developers
care about.</p>

<h3>Try onVeracity.com</h3>

<p>And now we've made things even easier with the launch of our cloud hosting service.
When you sign up, your private collaboration server will be
hosted at YOURNAME.onVeracity.com.  You administer the users and
access permissions.  We keep everything running.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://onVeracity.com/">onVeracity.com</a> service is alive and running now.  
We'll leave the
"beta" label on it for
a few more weeks until we get enough user feedback to confirm that everything
is running smoothly for all our users.</p>
