<p>Vault 3.1 is now <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads.html">released</a>!&nbsp; This is a free upgrade for all customers of Vault 3.0.</p>
<p>We consider Vault 3.1 to be a maintenance release.&nbsp; As such, it should probably have a version number like 3.0.8.&nbsp; However, the changes and improvements were too extensive to be consistent with the expectations which would be set by that kind of a version number.&nbsp; And, since 3.1 doesn't really have any major new features, we can't call it 4.0.&nbsp; So it's 3.1.</p>
<p>But please don't hear me say that this release is unimportant.&nbsp; It contains hundreds of bug fixes and small improvements.&nbsp; Vault 3.1 is an especially big win for our larger customer sites.&nbsp; The server is now faster, more efficient with RAM usage, and behaves better under load.</p>
<p>Finally, Vault 3.1 brings compatibility with the next wave of stuff from Microsoft, including .NET Framework 2.0, Visual Studio 2005, and SQL Server 2005.</p>
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; We're recommending that all Vault users switch to 3.1.</p>
