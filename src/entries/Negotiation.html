<p>Most people <i>hate</i> to negotiate.&nbsp; They don't like the
confrontational aspect.&nbsp; They worry that they are not getting a good deal.&nbsp; They
feel stress and fear.&nbsp; Some people will do almost anything to avoid it.&nbsp; Saturn
built an entire car company around this sentiment.</p>

<p>But good negotiation skills are valuable for anyone, and
essential for an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of books on the topic of negotiation.&nbsp;
But when I go to my local bookstore and see those books on the shelf, I can't
help but think that the topic is getting blown out of proportion.&nbsp; In my
experience, negotiation just isn't that complicated.</p>

<p>I've done lots of negotiation.&nbsp; I've argued with car
salesmen.&nbsp; I've done consulting deals at four, five and six figures.&nbsp; I've closed
a million-dollar technology sale.&nbsp; I've haggled with gypsies over the price of
a table cloth in rural Spain.&nbsp; Through it all, there is one principle that
matters more than anything else.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In
negotiation, the one thing that really strengthens your position is the ability
to walk away from the deal.</span></p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Sounds simple, right?&nbsp; It should be, but people still get
themselves into all kinds of trouble.&nbsp; Most people think the key to negotiation
is figuring out how to manipulate the other person's perspective.&nbsp; I'll admit
that those tactics can be somewhat effective, but the genuine ability to walk
away from a deal is far more powerful.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Negotiating from a position of real need is a bad, bad
situation.&nbsp; You are almost certainly going to lose.&nbsp; The other party will push
until they find your threshold of pain.&nbsp; Examples here include:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Bartering about salary when you are unemployed.</li>
 <li >Raising venture capital when your company is almost out of
     cash.</li>
 <li >Buying a car when you really have to buy one.</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize that things happen which are beyond our control.&nbsp;
Some of these situations are unfortunate and unavoidable.&nbsp; But in any
negotiation, your best investment is to figure out a way to get by if the deal
falls through.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Practice this principle the next time you buy a car:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Start shopping for a car <i>before</i> you really need
     to.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >Before starting the negotiation for any specific vehicle,
     clearly understand your fallback plan.&nbsp; What will you do if you don't get
     this car?&nbsp; Buy something else?&nbsp; Take the bus?&nbsp; Ride your bike?</li>
 <li >Don't let yourself get emotionally attached to the car
     until it's yours.</li>
 <li >Figure out in advance what you want to pay.&nbsp; If you can't
     get the deal you want, walk out.&nbsp; You can always come back later if you
     want.</li>
</ol>

<p>My current vehicle is a Chevy Avalanche.&nbsp; When I was shopping
for it, I went to my local Chevy dealer, picked out a truck, figured out what I
wanted to pay, and made an offer.</p>

<p>The sales guy smiled at me and said, "That's absurd."</p>

<p>I calmly replied, "I am quite certain you will make a profit
if you sell me this truck at the price I have offered.&nbsp; It won't be your most
profitable deal this month, but you'll make money, and you'll get a vehicle off
your lot.&nbsp; But either way, I am going to buy a Chevy Avalanche.&nbsp; Somebody is
going to accept this offer.&nbsp; The only question is whether it's going to be you
or somebody else."</p>

<p>In the end, the sales guy started playing games and I walked
out.&nbsp; Two days later I made the same offer to his competitor in a nearby town
and drove home in my new truck.</p>

<p>Whether you're buying or selling, whether it's a car or a
table cloth or a company, the principle always works the same way.&nbsp; The way to
get burned is to spend all your time daydreaming about how wonderful things
will be after the deal is done.&nbsp; The way to win is to carefully figure out how
tolerable things will be after the deal falls through.&nbsp; In almost every case,
the winner of a negotiation is the party who is best prepared for the
possibility of the deal not happening at all.</p>
