<p>Last week I was considering the purchase of a piece of
software.&nbsp; I went to the vendor's website for pricing.&nbsp; It wasn't there.&nbsp;
Annoyed, I filled out the form so that I could be contacted by one of their <a
href="/bos/Closing_the_Gap_Part_1.html">sales people</a>.&nbsp; The
following day I got a response:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Thanks for considering (product
name deleted).&nbsp; Please write back to me with your phone # or call me at the #
below -- we can discuss pricing as I learn about your application and how you
plan to use (product name deleted) for development.</p>

<p>So I sent an email with the following response:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Hi (name deleted),</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>OK.&nbsp; Please bear with me for just a
moment while I vent.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>#ifdef FRUSTRATED_RANT</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>First, I hate the fact that you
guys don't put pricing on your website.&nbsp; I looked up the old version of your
site using archive.org, so I've got a ballpark idea of what the pricing was
around six months ago.&nbsp; Mostly I just want to know if anything has changed.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Second, it's absurd that when a
customer asks for pricing, you won't give it to them.&nbsp; Instead, you answer the
question with a question.&nbsp; I'm not even the slightest bit interested in telling
you about our application and how we plan to use (product name deleted) for
development.&nbsp; I just want to know your pricing and your license terms.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>And for the hat trick, it's
incredibly frustrating that you want to do this by phone.&nbsp; I hate phones with a
passion, especially when they're completely unnecessary.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Bottom line:&nbsp; I'm interested in
buying your product.&nbsp; The only obstacle in my way is YOU.&nbsp; If your product
didn't have such a great reputation, I would give up right now.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>#endif</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>OK, sorry about that.&nbsp; I figured if
I get all this off my chest then I'll have a much better chance of getting
through our phone call without saying anything rude.&nbsp; Please call me at
217-XXX-YYYY.&nbsp; I promise to be nice.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>-- </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Eric</p>

<p>Fortunately, my "vent before the call" strategy worked out
very well.&nbsp; The sales person called me and we had a very pleasant and cordial
conversation.</p>
