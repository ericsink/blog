<p>I think <a
href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7559501075">this</a>
is fascinating.</p>

<p>It's an eBay auction, and a somewhat unusual one.&nbsp; Jim Lamb
is selling his Micro-ISV.&nbsp; He's got a photo management application called
BrilliantPhoto.&nbsp; He just swallowed the red pill (he's going to work for
Microsoft) so he doesn't have time to build/maintain/promote/sell/support a
software product anymore.&nbsp; Jim is trying to sell the whole package, including
full ownership of the product, the source code, his website, and the domain
name.</p>

<p>On eBay.</p>

<p>Like I said, I think this idea is interesting.&nbsp; Sales of
this kind happen all the time, but not on eBay.&nbsp; They happen behind closed
doors in secret discussions where the person with the best negotiation skills
wins.&nbsp; For every ten such discussions that begin, nine deals fall through.</p>

<p>On eBay it will be very different.&nbsp; There is no reserve.&nbsp;
The deal is going to happen (barring fraud or some other oddity).&nbsp; And this
time, the rest of us get to watch.&nbsp; Or even bid.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>(Jim's decision to use eBay was apparently inspired by <a
href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.238965.16">another
auction</a>.&nbsp; Evidently somebody bought <a href="http://jux2.com/">jux2</a> (a
search engine, never heard of it before) for over $100K.&nbsp; Assuming the deal was
legit, that's a heckuva lot of money for an eBay auction, especially when the
item being sold is not physical property.)</p>

<p>I don't really know much photo management apps, but I assume
that this is a reasonably large market and that there are <i>lots</i> of
competitors out there.&nbsp; Still, BrilliantPhoto seems like it might be deserving
of a slice of the pie.&nbsp; I just downloaded the demo version and very briefly
gave it a whirl.&nbsp; It installed with no problems.&nbsp; The app seems to work and the
UI has a very nice level of polish.</p>

<p>Don't expect eBay to take over the merger/acquisition market
anytime soon.&nbsp; Several reasons come to mind:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I seriously doubt it is legal to sell an actual business
     entity on eBay.&nbsp; The SEC has tons of regulations governing the sale of a
     corporation.&nbsp; Any auction website where people try to sell <a
     href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ebay+chewing+gum+britney+spears">used
     celebrity chewing gum</a> is not going to be able to comply with the
     rules.&nbsp; The BrilliantPhoto auction is an asset sale, which is quite
     different from a corporate acquisition.&nbsp; BTW, asset sales usually get
     lower valuations than the sale of a business entity.</li>
 <li >I can't imagine trying to use an eBay auction to sell
     anything larger than a Micro-ISV.&nbsp; Heck, I think it's weird to sell
     intellectual property on eBay for 5 and 6 figure numbers.&nbsp; When the price
     gets into the millions or tens of millions, there are better ways to solve
     the problem.</li>
 <li >A purchase of this kind usually involves a due-diligence
     phase.&nbsp; The buyer gets to review the source code and/or the historical
     revenue numbers.&nbsp; This auction doesn't list that kind of information.&nbsp;
     It's not likely that the seller would <i>want</i> it publicly visible on
     the eBay website for all to see.</li>
 <li >Selling a software business on eBay is not the way to earn
     top dollar for your sale.&nbsp; However, to be fair, I should acknowledge that this
     problem is not specific to eBay.&nbsp; Nobody gets top dollar when they <i>want</i>
     to sell.&nbsp; The conventional wisdom says it like this:&nbsp; "Software businesses
     are bought, not sold."</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite all this, a Micro-ISV is special and different in
many ways from a larger small company.&nbsp; I'll be watching this auction to see
what happens.</p>
