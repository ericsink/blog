<p>Today's issue of <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/">SD Times</a> contains an <a href="http://68.236.189.240/article/story-20050215-13.html">article</a> about our <a href="/entries/allerton.html">Allerton</a> project.</p>
<p>As an ISV, working with the press is always <em>interesting</em>.&nbsp; Their job is not to tell the story you want them to tell, but rather, to tell whatever story is most interesting for their readers.&nbsp; Your inputs are a press release and a phone interview.&nbsp; In the end, the output is an article which may or may not be what you envisioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's not, you console yourself by saying "there is no such thing as bad press".&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>This piece is actually pretty good, but it's not really an article about SourceGear.&nbsp; It's an article about Microsoft and whether or not they are a good partner.&nbsp; I can see how readers probably find that angle interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, no real complaints here.&nbsp; To Jennifer deJong and SD Times, thanks for the article!</p>
