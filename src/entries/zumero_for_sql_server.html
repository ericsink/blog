<p>It has been seven months (to the day) since our initial launch of <a href="http://zumero.com/">Zumero</a>.</p>

<p>We believe in launching early and iterating
quickly, guided by customer feedback.  This week, as a result of that feedback,
we are releasing a preview of our second product, Zumero for SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Our initial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">MVP</a> 
(now called Zumero Cloud) was (and still is) cloud-hosted.  Since its launch in March, the
number-one request we have received (by far) has been for an on-prem server.
Amidst all the buzz around "cloud" and "Backend as a Service", we are hearing from an
awful lot of people who want "Backend as a Product", provided to them as software
they can install and manage for themselves.  Go figure.  <b><tt>:-)</tt></b></p>

<p>Furthermore, these customers want an incremental solution.  They're not
starting from scratch and looking for a new platform.  They already have data sitting 
in a SQL database.  
They already have web apps and other stuff which deal with that data.  They
don't want to change any of that.  They just want to add "mobile" as a new
ingredient in their soup.</p>

<p>Finally, 90% of this feedback (so far) is coming from people using Microsoft
SQL Server.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<h3>Zumero for SQL Server</h3>

<p>ZSS is, well, exactly what those folks have been asking us for.  It's an on-prem
installable server which provides synchronization between SQL Server databases 
and mobile devices.</p>

<p>And ZSS is designed to cause no disruption to existing stuff.  
It plays nicely with others and does not assume that it has exclusive control
over the data.</p>

<p>Our preview
release is available for download now at <a href="http://zumero.com/dev-center/zss/">http://zumero.com/dev-center/zss/</a>.</p>

<h3>Server and Manager</h3>

<p>ZSS consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>ZSS Server</li>
    <li>ZSS Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>The ZSS Server is a module for Internet Information Services (IIS).
Simply point it at your SQL Server
database (which need not be on the same machine) using an ODBC connection
string.  We include an easy-to-use installer as well as instructions for
people who prefer to do the installation manually.</p>

<p>ZSS Manager is a desktop application used to setup your data for sync.  You can specify which tables
you want your mobile devices to see and/or modify.  You can configure authentication
and permissions for your mobile users.</p>

<p>ZSS does not require you to make any changes to your existing database
schema, but it does need to install some new triggers and views.  The ZSS Manager
application generates the T-SQL for these items and displays it so that you
can review everything before any changes to your database are made.</p>

<h3>Availability and Pricing</h3>

<p>The 1.0 release of ZSS is just a few weeks away.</p>

<p>Once we finalize pricing, we will be publishing it on our website.  For now,
email <a href="mailto:sales@zumero.com">sales@zumero.com</a> and ask for more info.</p>
