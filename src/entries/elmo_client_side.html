title: What Mongo-ish API would mobile developers want?

<p>A couple weeks ago I <a href="/entries/mobile_sync_for_mongo.html">blogged</a> about mobile sync for MongoDB.</p>

<h2>Updated Status of Elmo</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zumero/Elmo">Embeddable Lite Mongo</a> continues to move forward nicely:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Progress on indexes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compound and multikey indexes are supported.</li>
            <li>Sparse indexes are not done yet.</li>
            <li>Index key encoding is different from the KeyString stuff that Mongo itself does.  For encoding numerics, I did an ugly-but-workable F# port of the encoding used by SQLite4.</li>
            <li>Hint is supported, but is poorly tested so far.</li>
            <li>Explain is supported, partially, and only for version 3 of the wire protocol.  More work to do there.</li>
            <li>The query planner (which has delusions of grandeur for even referring to itself by that term) isn't very smart.</li>
            <li>Indexes cannot yet be used for sorting.</li>
            <li>Indexes are currently never used to cover a query.</li>
            <li>When grabbing index bounds from the query, $elemMatch is ignored.  Because of this, and because of the way Mongo multikey indexes work, most index scans are bounded at only one end.</li>
            <li>The $min and $max query modifiers are supported.</li>
            <li>The query planner doesn't know how to deal with $or at all.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Progress on full-text search:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This feature is working for some very basic cases.</li>
            <li>Phrase search is not implemented yet.</li>
            <li>Language is currently ignored.</li>
            <li>The matcher step for $text is not implemented yet at all.  Everything within the index bounds will get returned.</li>
            <li>The tokenizer is nothing more than string.split.  No stemming.  No stop words.</li>
            <li>Negations are not implemented yet.</li>
            <li>Weights are stored in the index entries, but textScore is not calculated yet.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>I also refactored to get better separation between the CRUD logic and the storage of bson blobs and indexes (making it easier to plug-in different storage layers).</p>

<h2>Questions about client-side APIs</h2>

<p>So, let's assume you are building a mobile app which communicates with your
Mongo server in the cloud using a "replicate and sync" approach.  In other
words, your app is not doing its CRUD operations by making networking/REST calls back to
the server.  Instead, your app is working directly with a partial clone of the Mongo 
database that is right there on the mobile device.  (And periodically, that partial 
clone is magically synchronized with the main database on the server.)</p>

<p>What should the API for that "embedded lite mongo" look like?</p>

<p>Obviously, for each development environment, the form of the API should be
designed to feel natural or native in that environment.  This is the approach
taken by Mongo's own client drivers.  In fact, as far as I can tell, these
drivers don't even share much (or any?) code.  For example, the drivers for C# and Java
and Ruby are all different, and (unless I'm mistaken) none of them are mere
wrappers around something lower level like the C driver.  Each one is built
and maintained to provide the most pleasant experience to developers in
a specific ecosystem.</p>

<p>My knee-jerk reaction here is to say that mobile developers might want
the exact same API as presented by their nearest driver.  For example, if
I am building a mobile app in C# (using the Xamarin tools), there is a good
chance my previous Mongo experience is also in C#, so I am familiar with
the C# driver, so that's the API I want.</p>

<p>Intuitive as this sounds, it may not be true.  Continuing with the C#
example, that driver is quite large.  Is its size appropriate for use on
a mobile device?  Is it even compatible with iOS, which requires AOT
compilation?  (FWIW, I tried compiling this driver as a PCL (Portable
Class Library), and it didn't Just Work.)</p>

<p>For Android, the same kinds of questions would need to be asked about
the Mongo Java driver.</p>

<p>And then there are Objective-C and Swift (the primary developer platform for iOS), for which there is no official Mongo driver.  But there are a couple of them listed on the Community Supported Drivers page: <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/community-supported-drivers/">http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/community-supported-drivers/</a>.</p>

<p>And we need to consider Phonegap/Cordova as well.  Is the Node.js driver a starting point?</p>

<p>And in all of these cases, if we assume that the mobile API should be the
same as the driver's API, how should that be achieved?  Fork the driver code
and rip out all the networking and replace it with calls to the embedded
library?</p>

<p>Or should each mobile platform get a newly-designed API which is
specifically for mobile use cases?</p>

<p>Believe it or not, some days I wonder:  Suppose I got Elmo running
as a server on an Android device, listening on localhost port 27017.  Could an Android app talk to it with the Mongo Java driver
unchanged?  Even if this would work, it would be more like a proof-of-concept than a production solution.
Still, when looking for solutions to a problem, the mind goes places...</p>

<p>So anyway, I've got more questions than answers here, and I would welcome thoughts or opinions.</p>
