<p>Wow.&nbsp; The rumors were true.&nbsp; The question of the day is who would buy a PowerPC Macintosh after Steve announced the switch to x86 chips from Intel?</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp; Because yesterday when we left for Orlando we had two Mac Minis packed in our luggage, specially prepared for giving great demos of Allerton here at TechEd.&nbsp; When we arrived and got our bags, they were gone.&nbsp; Some baggage handler in Atlanta stole our computers.</p>
<p>I don't have a heckuva lot of experience being the victim of a theft, so this was kind of a shock.&nbsp; The response from our airline was even more shocking.&nbsp; She rolled her eyes and said, "Yeah, the baggage people at Atlanta airport do this all the time."&nbsp; She was apologetic, but completely unsurprised.</p>
<p>So there you have it.&nbsp; We planned to spend today giving a really excellent demo of the Allerton client running on Mac OS X and talking to Team Foundation Server.&nbsp; Instead, we spent the day standing in the Allerton booth and telling people that the dog ate our homework.&nbsp; It was really embarrassing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at SourceGear world headquarters in Champaign, the folks there bought another Mac Mini, configured it and shipped it by FedEx for early delivery on Tuesday.&nbsp; The show must go on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose I will always remember this day.&nbsp; We bought a Mac Mini on the same day that Steve Jobs obsoleted the PowerPC.</p>
<p>Last night at the airport (around 1am, since our plane was really late), we saw <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/korbyp/">Korby Parnell</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/">Rob Caron</a> hanging around the baggage claim area.&nbsp; Their bags were locked in a room with glass walls.&nbsp; They could see them, but they could not have them.&nbsp; They tried for quite a while to call somebody to unlock that door, but nobody came.&nbsp; At the time, they seemed to be winning the competition for whose plight was the most pathetic.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we've got the lead now.</p>
