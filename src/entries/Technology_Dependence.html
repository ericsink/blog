<p>Sometimes I <i>hate</i> technology.</p>

<p>Several months ago I decided to turn over a new leaf and
start using better passwords.&nbsp; So when I got this cool new Sony Vaio laptop, I
set it up with a really good password that I had never used before.&nbsp; It was
long and it contained a bunch of mixed case letters and numbers and funky
punctuation.&nbsp; I made sure nobody was <i>ever</i> going to guess this password.&nbsp;
Not even me.</p>

<p>And then I immediately forgot it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this particular laptop has a fingerprint
sensor.&nbsp; What a cool piece of technology!&nbsp; I still have no idea what my
password is, but every morning I simply drag my index finger over the sensor and
Windows logs me in.</p>

<p>Last night in the woodshop I sliced my index finger open while
attempting to see if a plane iron was sharp yet.&nbsp; (It was.)</p>

<p>Today, my &amp;*%#$@! laptop thinks my fingerprint has
changed.</p>

<p>It was funny at first.&nbsp; I tried every password I could
remember.&nbsp; Then I started to get frustrated.</p>

<p>I searched my desk to see if perhaps I wrote the password
down somewhere.&nbsp; No luck.</p>

<p>After a while, I started to get angry.&nbsp; Why do things like
this always seem to happen before I've had any coffee?</p>

<p>I tried the finger swipe again.&nbsp; Nope.</p>

<p>My condition started to degrade from angry to irrational. &nbsp;I
hated computers.&nbsp; I considered dropping the laptop out my fourth floor window.</p>

<p>I tried swiping my index finger in all kinds of different
ways.&nbsp; Still no luck.</p>

<p>I wished I had never seen a computer before.&nbsp; I remembered the
Amish community just south of Champaign and wondered if they would take me in.</p>

<p>I tried using the middle finger instead.&nbsp; I knew it wouldn't
work, but at the time I just felt like that was the appropriate finger to use.</p>

<p>I picked up the phone to call my parents and blame them for
giving birth to me at the wrong point in history.&nbsp; And as I was dialing, the
fingerprint swipe suddenly worked, probably because I had been trying for so
long that my finger had time to heal.</p>

<p>The new password on my laptop is "Eric".&nbsp; And just in case I
forget my name, I'm going to write it on the outside of the case with a
Sharpie.</p>
