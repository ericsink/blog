<p>I walked into my office this morning to discover a large
package sitting on my chair.&nbsp; The box was from "Pinnacle Displays", which I
vaguely remembered to be a company that sells some sort of trade show display
stuff.&nbsp; I get junk mail from companies like that on a regular basis, so I
assumed this would be more of the same.&nbsp; Still, this box was <i>way</i> too big
and heavy to be regular junk mail.&nbsp; Anyway, I was pre-coffee, so I set it on
the floor of my office and decided to open it later.</p>

<p>By lunch I had tripped over this enormous box several times,
each time remarking to myself that the sender had paid way too much for
whatever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swag">swag</a> was inside.</p>

<p>Late this afternoon I finally decided to open the box and
see what the heck they had sent me.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It was a bag of Evo dog food.</p>

<p>The accompanying letter from Pinnacle's Steve Peterson
explained.&nbsp; I'll spare you the details and just say this:&nbsp; Steve wanted me to
place a link to his website at the bottom of my article <a
href="/bos/Trade_Shows.html">Going to a Trade Show</a>.&nbsp;
The bag of food for Sophie was the attention-getter/bribe.</p>

<p>If you visit that article now, you will see that I have
acceded to his request, but I struggled with the decision.&nbsp; I've turned down <i>lots</i>
of people asking to advertise on my blog.&nbsp; How did Steve Peterson get the link
he wanted by sending me a $30 bag of kibble?&nbsp; I've refused cash offers worth
hundreds of times more.</p>

<p>I guess I was just terribly impressed by how well Steve
executed this stunt.&nbsp; He perused my blog.&nbsp; He saw my story about <a
href="/entries/Absurd_Customer_Service.html">Absurd Customer Service</a>,
so he knew that I buy Evo.&nbsp; Then he not only found a place to buy it (which
probably wasn't easy), but he even got the right size bite for Sophie (a German
Shepherd).</p>

<p>But that wasn't enough.&nbsp; The whole gimmick would have
backfired if his cover letter sounded smarmy, but the tone was <i>perfect</i>.&nbsp;
This kind of thing is just so very hard to do well, and Steve nailed it. </p>

<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; I don't like it when people ask me for links
or ad placements here, so I really wanted to be annoyed at this guy, but the
feeling just wasn't there.&nbsp; The simple truth is that he didn't tick me off.&nbsp;
Knowing how little patience I have for anybody trying to sell me something, I
couldn't help but admire his accomplishment.</p>

<p>So, I offer a tip of my hat to Steve Peterson of Pinnacle
Displays.</p>

<p>Note that Sophie had no concerns at all about this whole
situation.&nbsp; She doesn't care in the slightest about her credibility. &nbsp;She'll do
just about anything for food.&nbsp; In fact, I know from experience that she will
happily trade her dignity for half an ounce of store brand mozzarella.</p>

<p>So she was very quick to volunteer to wear the graphics of
her new sponsor:</p>
