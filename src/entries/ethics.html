<h3>The Comment</h3>

<p>I've received a lot of feedback on <a
href="/entries/scrabble_1994.html">yesterday's blog entry</a>.&nbsp;
The two most common questions are:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Eric, why did you think that working on your Scrabble
     project was wrong?&nbsp; It doesn't seem all that bad.</li>
 <li >And since you thought it was so awful, can we assume that
     you would go ballistic if someone in your company was working on a pet
     project at the office?</li>
</ul>

<p>I sort of figured that if I wrote an article about a
software manager that I really admire, I didn't need to address the question of
how I would react in a similar situation.&nbsp; It should be fairly simple to
connect the dots.</p>

<p>But folks are having trouble with the fact that I held such a
strict attitude about my own transgression.&nbsp; They assume that I would be
similarly draconian with others.&nbsp; A fair assumption I suppose, but an incorrect
one.</p>

<p>When it comes to ethics, most people treat themselves
loosely and other strictly.&nbsp; Instead, try being strict with yourself and
gracious toward others.&nbsp; You'll get along a lot better with the world.</p>

<p>Do I really believe that working on a fun personal project
at work is such a heinous crime?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; But surely you can agree that
goofing off and trying to cover it up isn't exactly the way to win the employee
of the month award?</p>

<p>The truth is that I just don't believe in making excuses.&nbsp; I'm
not going to defend myself unless I have solid possession of the moral high
ground.</p>

<p>My kids read this blog.&nbsp; I'm trying to teach them to take
responsibility for <i>all</i> their choices, good and bad, big and small.&nbsp; How
can I do that if I'm not willing to set the example?</p>

<p>If I found somebody in my company working on a pet project
at work, I imagine I would handle it pretty much like Tim did:&nbsp; I would be more
disappointed in the company than in the individual.&nbsp; If people are working on
hobby code, then they're bored.&nbsp; In my opinion, the blame for a bored employee
splits about 80/20 toward management.</p>

<h3>The Correction</h3>

<p>Tim's current car is a Lamborghini, not a Ferrari.</p>
