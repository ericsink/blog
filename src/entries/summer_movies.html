<p>This weekend I saw Wall-E and The Dark Knight, both of which
are just amazingly good.&nbsp; Lately I'm thinking this may be the best summer of
movies ever.</p>

<p>Compared to cinematic masterpieces such as these, Paul
Roub's <a href="http://blog.roub.net/2008/07/explaining_fortress_visually.html">recent
videos</a> are kind of lame.&nbsp; His plot and characters are really anemic.&nbsp; I
need to talk to him about somehow working in a car chase scene and more
explosions.</p>

<p><b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Seriously, Paul has been making some short videos to offer a
different way of talking about our products.&nbsp; His <a
href="http://sourcegear.com/fortress/video/installation.html">latest one</a> is
my favorite:&nbsp; In order to show how quick and easy it is to setup SourceGear
Fortress, this video shows every step of the install from start to finish.&nbsp; The
video is 3 minutes and 12 seconds long.</p>

<p>These movies aren't exactly Iron Man, but they're still
pretty cool.</p>
