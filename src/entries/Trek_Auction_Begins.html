<p>The Star Trek auction started this morning.&nbsp; So far, the
bidding is simply insane.&nbsp; I've bid on a couple of items, but have not come
anywhere close to winning an item.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Lot 23, Captain Picard's chair from the Enterprise-E, was
     estimated to sell between $7,000 and $9,000.&nbsp; It sold for over $52,000.</li>
 <li >Lot 57, Captain Picard's toolkit from First Contact, was
     estimated to sell between $400 and $600.&nbsp; It sold for $7,500.</li>
 <li >Lot 61, Worf's Isomagentic Disintegrator Rifle, was
     estimated to sell between $600 and $800.&nbsp; It sold for $16,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/entries/Star_Trek_Auction.html">flute</a>
I want is lot 537.&nbsp; I plan to bid, but I suspect it's going to sell for a <i>lot</i>
more than I am willing to pay.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; </p>

<p>The flute has sold.&nbsp; The opening bid was $13,000, well above
the price range I had in mind.&nbsp; The final sale price was $40,000.</p>

<p>I am completely out of my league in this auction.&nbsp; I've bid
on at least a dozen lots and have won none of them.&nbsp; I'm still just amazed at
the prices.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
