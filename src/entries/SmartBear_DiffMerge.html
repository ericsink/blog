<p>I am pleased to announce that SourceGear and <a
href="http://smartbear.com/">Smart Bear Software</a> have reached an agreement
which will lead to the bundling of <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">SourceGear DiffMerge</a>
with Smart Bear's products.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed getting to know Smart Bear's founder, Jason
Cohen.&nbsp; Some companies are just likeable.&nbsp; The world often seems like a vast
sea of companies which are devoid of personality.&nbsp; And then every so often you
run across a company like Smart Bear, where the company tag line at the bottom
of their website is "All your code review are belong to us."&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Anyway, Jason has a very cool company with several products
for developers.&nbsp; Starting in September, DiffMerge will be bundled with two of
those products, Code Pickle and Code Collaborator.</p>
