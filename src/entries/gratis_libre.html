<p>So Jesús M. González-Barahona has discovered evidence to suggest that I am in fact a legend after all.&nbsp; Apparently, in the context of free software, I may have been the <a href="http://sinetgy.org/jgb/articulos/libre-software-origin/">first person</a> to use the Spanish words "gratis" and "libre" to distinguish between the two meanings of the English word "free".</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">(Background:&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> uses the word "free" but they mean "freedom", not "zero-cost".&nbsp; This ends up being a constant source of confusion.)</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten about that <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=1992May11.134415.21977%40sunb10.cs.uiuc.edu">USENET post</a> until I got email from this gentleman a couple of days ago.&nbsp; Now I'm wondering what else I might have done that I forgot about.&nbsp; If anybody happens to find any evidence indicating that I was actually the person who invented something like Hypercard or VisiCalc, please let me know.&nbsp; <tt>:-)</tt></p>
