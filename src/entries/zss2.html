title: Announcing Zumero for SQL Server, Release 2.0
date: 2015-05-08 12:00:00
---

<p>Zumero for SQL Server (ZSS) is a solution for replication and sync
between SQL Server and mobile devices.  ZSS can be used to create
offline-friendly mobile apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, PhoneGap,
and Xamarin.</p>

<p>Our 2.0 release is a major step forward in the maturity
of the product.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>
    <b>Compatibility with Azure SQL</b> -- 
    This release offers improved compatibility with Microsoft Azure SQL Database.
    Whether you prefer cloud or on-prem, ZSS 2.0 is a robust sync solution.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
    <b>Improved filtering</b> -- 
    In the 2.0 release, filters have become more powerful and easier to use.
    Arcane limitations of the 1.x filtering feature have been lifted.  New
    capabilities include filtering by date, and filtering of incoming writes.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
    <b>Schema change detection</b> -- 
    The handling of schema changes is now friendlier to the use of other
    SQL tools.  In 1.x, schema changes needed to be performed in the ZSS
    Manager application.  In 2.0, we detect and handle most
    schema changes automatically, allowing you to integrate ZSS 
    without changing the way you do things.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
    <b>Better UI for configuration</b> -- 
    The ZSS Manager application has been improved to include UI
    for configuration of multiple backend databases, as well as more fine-grained
    control of which columns in a table are published for sync.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
    <b>Increased Performance</b> -- 
    Perhaps most important of all, ZSS 2.0 is faster.  In some situations, it
    is a LOT faster.
    </p></li>

</ul>
