<p>I frequently see postings like <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/chaoticset/90124.html">this one</a> from people who want to comment on something I said here on my weblog.&nbsp; I have finally decided to try running a <a href="http://discuss.ericsink.com/viewforum.php?f=2">forum</a> for people who want to discuss stuff that I say.</p>
<p>Fair warning:&nbsp; On my forum site, I reserve the right to act as moderator.&nbsp; More specifically, it would be best to think of me as Supreme Dictator.&nbsp; There is no system of checks and balances in the government of my forum.&nbsp; My power over the forum is absolute.&nbsp; If this is unacceptable, find another forum.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do intend to be a reasonably benevolent dictator.&nbsp; All are welcome.&nbsp; If you want to discuss something I say here on my weblog, free free to post a message.</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; Yes, I plan to continue visiting <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/">Joel's forum</a>&nbsp;regularly.</p>
