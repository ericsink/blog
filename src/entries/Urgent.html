<p>SourceGear's mail room is where we keep the photocopier, fax
machine and postage meter.&nbsp; It's also a storage place for office supplies,
Kleenex, and the primary cause of most traffic into that room, candy.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago I walked over to the mail room to get a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Kat">Kit Kat</a>.&nbsp; On the fax machine I
saw that we had received a page with the words "URGENT MEMO" in large letters
across the top.&nbsp; Instantly I <i>knew</i> that it was a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_fax">junk fax</a>.</p>

<p>The word "urgent" isn't really all that useful anymore,
because everybody who uses it is lying.&nbsp; In theory, the word "urgent" means
"compelling immediate action or attention".&nbsp; Much to the dismay of my high
school English teacher, most dictionaries today are regularly updated to be
consistent with how words are typically used.&nbsp; How long before the dictionaries
update the definition of "urgent" to reflect the most prevalent usage?&nbsp; If they
did, one of the definitions of "urgent" would be "trivial, utterly useless, a
complete waste of time".</p>

<p>As a writer, I find this terribly sad, but I see it so often
that I'm numb.&nbsp; Every evening I go home and sort the junk mail that showed up
in our mailbox that day.&nbsp; Although I do lament the way our language is being eroded
away, I have to appreciate the steps they've taken to make my sorting job
easier:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >When I see an envelope that says, "Do not discard this
     envelope", I know immediately that it will be safe for me to throw it away
     unopened.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >When I see an envelope that says "Special Offer", I know with
     certainty that the offer contained therein is <i>not</i> special, and was
     in fact distributed to everybody with a pulse.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >When I see an envelope telling me that I've won, I see a
     completely unambiguous message.&nbsp; There could be no clearer way to
     communicate to me that I have in fact <i>not</i> won anything at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>The shocking part of this story is that the people who send
junk mail can't figure all this out.&nbsp; Take the word "urgent" off the outside of
the envelope and I am far more likely to be deceived into thinking that it is
actually urgent.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.&nbsp; After all, anybody who
tries to make their living using a fax machine to sell trips to Canc√∫n is
probably not the sharpest knife in the drawer.</p>

<p>Still, don't these people get junk mail everyday like the
rest of us?&nbsp; Don't they get junk faxes and email spam?&nbsp; You'd think they would
eventually realize that the importance of any piece of information is inversely
correlated to how important that piece of information is claiming to be.</p>

<p>Take this blog entry, for example.&nbsp; Here you are, over 400
words into it.&nbsp; Why did you come this far?&nbsp; You knew when you saw the title
that I have absolutely nothing useful to say.</p>
