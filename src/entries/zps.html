<h2>Building mobile apps is really hard.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why does my app work in the simulator but not on the device?</li>
<li>How do I get 60 frames-per-second UI performance on Android?</li>
<li>How do I manage concurrent access to my mobile database?</li>
<li>How do I deal with limited memory?</li>
<li>How do I keep something running in the background?</li>
<li>I have to compile for how many different CPU architectures?!?</li>
</ul>

<p>Building apps for mobile devices involves a dizzying array of
technologies and tooling.  The explosion of mobile offers
more ways for software projects to fail than ever before.</p>

<p>Zumero would like to help.</p>

<p>We can build your app for you.  Or we can assist or advise as
you build it yourself.</p>

<h2>Both New and Old</h2>

<p>Zumero for SQL Server is the best solution for syncing SQL
data with mobile devices.  Now we're looking ahead to providing more
ways of helping developers build great business apps for mobile
devices.  We have additional products in the pipeline, but it is
already clear that <a href="http://zumero.com/services/">Zumero Professional Services</a> is going to be
an important piece of our story.</p>

<p>To some degree, we are formalizing what we are already
doing for our <a href="http://zumero.com/customers/">customers</a>.  They're building apps to solve business
problems, and they're constantly experiencing the reality that
mobile app development is really, really hard.  We often get
involved in ways that go beyond the use of our product, helping
with issues like concurrency and integration with native code.</p>

<p>So yes, Zumero Professional Services is a new thing for us.
We see this as an opportunity because of the explosion of business apps being built.
But it is also an old thing.  We've done this before.</p>

<p>A number of years ago we did a lot of custom software development on 
mobile devices for companies like Motorola.  This was back when smartphones weren't
actually very smart.  We built stuff
that was burned into the phone's ROM, with CPU and memory constraints that make
an iPhone look like a supercomputer.  We had things like massive test
suites with high code coverage.  </p>

<p>We got out of that market, but now we're back, and even though the mobile industry
has changed dramatically, many of the core technology challenges are still the same.
This feels like a return to our roots.</p>
