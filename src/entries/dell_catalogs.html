title: It's not really my place to criticize...

<p>I read the papers.&nbsp; All the articles about the <a href="http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=162100445">IBM/Lenovo deal</a> say that <a href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> is the "number-one" PC vendor in the world.&nbsp; In the last 12 months, this company took 3 BILLION dollars of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=DELL&amp;annual">profit</a> on 49 BILLION dollars of revenue.&nbsp; This is amazing.</p>
<p>Even more amazing is the fact that they did this selling <em>PCs</em>, a business where they have a thousand competitors selling products that are all basically the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell is obviously a successful company.&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly doesn't need marketing advice from a small-time entrepreneur at a little software company in the middle of the giant cornfield known as Illinois.&nbsp; It's not my place to criticize a firm that can generate incredible numbers like these.</p>
<p>So I won't.</p>
<p>But it's just that I went for a walk earlier this afternoon.&nbsp; The cornfield has unusually nice weather today, and I couldn't resist taking a lap around the block to enjoy the breeze.&nbsp; On the way back, I figured I might as well stop at the mailbox and save somebody else the trouble of going out to pickup today's pile of dead-tree spam.</p>
<p><em>(Holy cow!&nbsp; Do we get this much mail every day?)</em></p>
<p>As I walked into the building, I noticed that Dell sent us a catalog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I noticed we got more than one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, we got THIRTEEN of them!&nbsp; Now I'm curious.&nbsp; How the heck did Dell decide that we needed thirteen copies of their May 2005 catalog?&nbsp; Are these all addressed to named individuals?</p>
<p>So let's cut to the chase.&nbsp; Here's the final score:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three catalogs to individuals who are employed at SourceGear right now.&nbsp; (In Dell's defense, I'll admit that one of these was addressed to the guy who buys most of our equipment.&nbsp; One out of thirteen isn't <em>too</em> bad.)
</li>
<li>Five catalogs to individuals who no longer work here.&nbsp; All of them have been gone for over a year.&nbsp; One of them has been gone for over three years.
</li>
<li>One catalog to a person who worked for Spyglass, my former employer and the previous tenant of this building, over eight years ago.
</li>
<li>Four catalogs to people I have <em>never</em> heard of before.
</li>
</ul>
<p>But like I said, I'm not criticizing anybody.&nbsp; That's not my job.</p>
