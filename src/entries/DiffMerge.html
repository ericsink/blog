<p>In the midst of the new products we have just released there
is one item which deserves to have a brighter light shown on it:&nbsp; SourceGear <a
href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">DiffMerge</a> is our new
application for comparing files and directories.&nbsp; And it's FREE!!!</p>

<p>Sorry, the word "free" is another one of those words that is
mostly useless, so I'll explain more:</p>

<p>DiffMerge is "free of charge", or as some folks say, "free
as in beer".&nbsp; DiffMerge is not <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a>
nor is it "free" in the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">Richard Stallman</a>
sense of the word.&nbsp; DiffMerge is a no-cost application that anyone can <a
href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html">download</a> and use.&nbsp; It
is not a trial, a demo or an eval.&nbsp; It is fully functional and fully featured.</p>

<h3>Why does the world need another diff tool?</h3>

<p>We admit that there are a heckuva lot of diff and merge
tools out there already.&nbsp; Some of them are darn good.&nbsp; So why did we create
another one?</p>

<p>Because we thought ours could be one of the best.</p>

<p>A lot of the diff and merge tools out there are just very
basic in their feature set.&nbsp; Even among the good ones, most of the file
comparison tools I've seen involve some kind of compromise.&nbsp; I lost track of
how many times I've said one of the following:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Yep, that's a great diff tool, but it doesn't do merging.</li>
 <li >Yep, that's a great diff tool, but it only runs on
     Windows.</li>
 <li >Yep, that's a great diff tool, but it's really expensive.</li>
 <li >Yep, that's a great diff tool, but it has little or no
     editing capabilities.</li>
 <li >Yep, that's a great diff tool, but you can't customize it
     much.</li>
 <li >Yep, that's a great diff tool, but coughs up a furball if
     you give it a Unicode file.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we're unveiling SourceDiffMerge 3.0 as our attempt to be
the best of the breed.&nbsp; I'm not sure we've hit the target, but we've come very
close.&nbsp; Highlights include:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Compare two text files</li>
 <li >Lots of supported character encodings</li>
 <li >Intra-line highlighting of the changed portion of a line</li>
 <li >Three-way merge, including automatic merge whenever
     possible</li>
 <li >Compare folders</li>
 <li >Cross-platform:&nbsp; Runs on Windows and Mac OS X.&nbsp; Oh, and
     Linux too.</li>
 <li >Full support for editing</li>
 <li >Fully customizable</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're using our newly-released Vault 4.0 or Fortress
1.0, then you've already got this app.&nbsp; For everybody else, regardless of
whether you are a SourceGear customer or not, I invite you to <a
href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html">download DiffMerge</a>
and give it a try.&nbsp; Did we create the best diff and merge tool in the world?&nbsp;
Let me know.</p>
