<h3>Short Version</h3>

<p>Sorry folks, until further notice, my blog does not support
comments.</p>

<h3>Long Version</h3>

<p>I've been using Haloscan for comments on this blog.</p>

<p>Haloscan is being turned off by the company that acquired
it.</p>

<p>That company offered a transition to a new service, but that
transition requires more effort than I am willing to invest (zero).</p>

<p>I downloaded all the old comments in some sort of XML file,
but doing anything with that file would require effort.</p>

<p>Investigating other ways of providing comments for this blog
would also require effort.</p>

<p>A day may come when the laziness of this blogger fails, when
I forsake my procrastination and break all bonds of inertia, but it is not this
day.</p>
