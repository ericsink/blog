<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/teched"><img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="100" alt="" src="/images/illbethere_8.gif" width="140" align="right" border="0" /></a>I am really looking forward to Tech-Ed next week.&nbsp; However, I always dread the tedium and frustrations of the travel.&nbsp; For me, the worst part of the air travel experience is trying to get through a crowded airport when I'm in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My weblog has a lot of regular readers now.&nbsp; With a glimmer of hope that I have enough readers to make a difference, I would like to offer this brief tutorial on the proper behavior in an airport:</p>
<p>When you are in an airport terminal or concourse, your primary goal (aside from safety, obviously), should be to <em>not</em> annoy the pathologically impatient people like me.&nbsp; There are three ways you can achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk quickly.
</li>
<li>Walk in a straight line.
</li>
<li>Watch where you are walking.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you don't have to do all three.&nbsp; The minimal standard here is easy -- just pick one.&nbsp; If you choose <em>any</em> of these three options, those of us who are "addicted to hurry" will probably be able to avoid you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a stunning number of people somehow find a way to ignore all three choices.&nbsp; Don't believe me?&nbsp; As you fly to Orlando this weekend, pay close attention and you'll see that I'm right.&nbsp; In every airport I have visited, a disturbing percentage of the people are meandering slowly while looking in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>And I'm not talking here about kids here.&nbsp; As a father of two young daughters, I understand that extra forebearance is sometimes required in the presence of young ones who don't know any better.&nbsp; It is a foregone conclusion that children don't know how to behave in an airport.</p>
<p>No, the real issue here is all of those otherwise rational adults who believe that patience is some sort of a virtue.&nbsp; For some crazy reason, these folks are just wandering around enjoying the day, as if the purpose of technology were to save time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll close this rant with a call to action:&nbsp; As you travel to Tech-Ed, please spread the word about this important element of airport etiquette.&nbsp; If we each tell just a few people, we can make a difference, and maybe, just maybe, I will make my connecting flight this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; If you'll be at Tech-Ed, be sure to stop by the SourceGear Vault booth.&nbsp; We're giving away Vault-branded packages of microwave popcorn!&nbsp; (In a few months, our current set of Vault ads will be retired and replaced with a bunch of new stuff.&nbsp; Ever since we unveiled the original Vault movie <a href="http://www.vaultthemovie.com/">trailer</a>, we have wanted to do this popcorn thing.&nbsp; Now that our movie-themed messaging will be coming to end, this trade show is our last chance.)</p>
