<p>All of the material I publish here on my weblog is provided with no obligation of any kind.&nbsp; However, I'm not saying that my articles are "free".&nbsp; I'm just saying that there is "no obligation".&nbsp; There's a difference.</p>
<p>We've all heard the old saying, "There is no such thing as a free lunch".&nbsp; Most of us know from experience that this maxim is essentially always true.&nbsp; Many things can be obtained without direct financial cost, but in most cases, there is some kind of a "price" to be paid, even if that price is indirect or non-financial.</p>
<p>My weblog is not a free lunch.&nbsp; There is a price associated with the articles I publish here.&nbsp; First of all, you have to suffer through my absurdly low editorial standards, as evidenced by more-than-occasional digressions on topics which range from&nbsp;<a href="/entries/teched_07jun2005.html">luggage</a> to <a href="/entries/looking_ahead_vault_4_5.html">cats</a> to <a href="/item_10164.html">cookies</a> to <a href="/F5.html">pool cover pumps</a>.</p>
<p>More importantly, the price you pay for the articles I publish here is the fact that I sprinkle them with subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) mentions of SourceGear's products.&nbsp; In this respect, it is reasonable to compare my weblog to broadcast television, where the shows are sprinkled with commercials.&nbsp; There is no obligation to actually buy the products being advertised during those commercials.&nbsp; Similarly, there is no obligation here to actually buy any of SourceGear's products.&nbsp; In fact, I routinely get email from people who appreciate my articles and who are not SourceGear customers.&nbsp; I don't mind at all.&nbsp; Increased awareness of SourceGear is a part of my motivation for writing, and I don't apologize for that, but it's only one part.&nbsp; Whether you buy our stuff or not, I am always delighted when I hear that my writings are helpful to someone.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of that.&nbsp; I just thought it would be best to insert a bunch of "no obligation" rhetoric before I bluntly ask you for money.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>My wife Lisa is currently training to run the <a href="http://disneyworldsports.disney.go.com/dwws/en_US/marathon/events/detail?name=FullMarathon2006EventInfoEventDetailPage">Walt Disney World Marathon</a> in January.&nbsp; In conjunction with this event, she has signed up with a program called <a href="http://www.teamintraining.org/">Team in Training</a> to help raise money to fight leukemia.&nbsp; I am asking my readers to consider making a donation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you personally know a family who has been affected by leukemia (as Lisa does), you understand what a terrible and heart-breaking disease it is.&nbsp; Team in Training is a program run by the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>, a <a href="http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=4414">fine organization</a> whose mission is to raise funds for research and patient services for leukemia and related disorders.</p>
<p>Two details worth mentioning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Team in Training usually provides airfare and hotel to the athletes who raise funds.&nbsp; In this case, Lisa has waived this benefit, thus allowing me to make the following statement:&nbsp; I have absolutely no conflict of interest in making this appeal.&nbsp; Neither I nor Lisa nor SourceGear will derive any financial benefit from your donation.&nbsp; The only benefit Lisa is receiving from Team in Training is the support of having a group of people with whom she can train for her first marathon.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>I am not asking anyone to do something that I would not.&nbsp; Lisa and I will be making a substantial donation to Team in Training, in addition to our travel expenses.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to join us in supporting this worthy cause, you can make a donation on the web with your credit card by clicking <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntil/LisaSink">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>
