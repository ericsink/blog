<p><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/">Hoover's</a> collects information about companies and sells it to other companies.&nbsp; Last year, they were acquired by <a href="http://www.dnb.com/">Dun and Bradstreet</a>.&nbsp; D&amp;B was founded in 1841 and is almost certainly the world leader in their market.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that this company is "mainstream" in the business world.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was surprised to learn that the Hoover's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hoovers.com/sourcegear/--ID__106750--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml">overview</a> on SourceGear contains information which could only be found on my weblog.&nbsp; The byline says we are covered by an analyst named Jeff Dorsch, and I have never spoken with this gentleman personally.&nbsp; In the course of researching SourceGear, he not only visited my weblog, but also my silly <a href="http://notalegend.com/">Not-A-Legend</a> site.</p>
<p>I recognize that weblogs have obviously been steadily gaining traction over the last few years, but this still comes as a pleasant shock.&nbsp; I would have assumed that it would take several more years before firms like Hoover's and D&amp;B would use weblogs in their research.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, I know that everything I write here is accessible by anyone in the world.&nbsp; However, I still think of my site and its readership as an exclusive club, the members of which are all geeks and early adopters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal people are not allowed, not because I deny them access, but because they simply don't know where to look.</p>
<p>If I cared enough to preserve the elitism of my club, I suppose I could just require a login.&nbsp; Instead of username/password authentication, I would ask my visitors a question that only a clueful geek could answer:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In vi, which key moves the cursor one character to the right?</li>
<li>What is the last name of the person who created Java?</li>
<li>True or false:&nbsp; In the original episode IV, Greedo shot first.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would fun, but the fact is that I <em>like</em> the notion that normal people are starting to read weblogs.&nbsp; This change is not bad -- it's just different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff, you and your ilk are quite welcome here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And BTW, your number for SourceGear's 2003 revenue is wrong.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
