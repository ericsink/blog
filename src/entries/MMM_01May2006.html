 <li >OK, so my sense of humor gets a little <a
     href="/entries/Vault_DreamWeaver.html">too subtle</a>
     sometimes.&nbsp; The joke was that I was referring to Dreamweaver users as if
     they are a foreign culture.&nbsp; But we really do have a Dreamweaver plugin
     for Vault coming out with version 3.5.&nbsp; That part wasn't a joke.&nbsp; <b>:-)<br>

 <li >Better late than never:&nbsp; Everybody has already told you
     that Bob Walsh's book (<a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/sawdust08-20">Micro-ISV:&nbsp;
     From Vision to Reality</a>) is really good.&nbsp; They're right.&nbsp; I've been
     reading it lately and am enjoying it.&nbsp; The book is very visually
     appealing, and he got some really interesting interviews with software
     entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Recommended.<br>

 <li >I did an <a
     href="http://www.thechrispirilloshow.com/help/20060429_eric_sink_on_the_business_of_software.phtml">interview</a>
     last week with Chris Pirillo.&nbsp; Talking with Chris brought back fond
     memories of Gnomedex 2003, which was the event where we first did the "Not
     a Legend" stunt.&nbsp; The life-sized cardboard cutout of me is still hanging
     around our office.&nbsp; It has a tendency to show up in unexpected places,
     especially when new people are hired.<br>
     <br>

 <li >On April 23<sup>rd</sup>, the Champaign newspaper did an
     article about my book (note that the article is not posted online).&nbsp; It
     was the #3 story in the business section that day, front page, below the
     fold.&nbsp; The #2 story was a feature about <a
     href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/2006/04/23/homer_couple_finding_wide_appeal_for_buckets_filled_with_junk_food">Redneck
     Snack Baskets</a>.&nbsp; I have decided not to draw any conclusions from this.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I still have a lot to learn about book publishing.&nbsp; The
     latest thing to pique my curiosity is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu.com</a>.&nbsp;
     It's a concept called Print-On-Demand (POD).&nbsp; Send Lulu a PDF file and
     they will sell it in book form, printing a copy only when someone orders
     one.&nbsp; I just ordered one of their books and sure enough, it's a book.&nbsp; I'm
     not saying that POD is going to change the publishing industry overnight,
     but I still find it really interesting.&nbsp; Lulu would be a great option for
     a low-volume/high-price book.&nbsp; Traditional publishers can't touch things
     like that.&nbsp; BTW, the guy behind Lulu is Bob Young, founder of Red Hat.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >My experience with Windows Vista lasted about two weeks.&nbsp;
     The machine seemed unhealthy from the beginning and it got sicker and
     sicker until the day it died.&nbsp; On the day I installed Vista I bought a
     loaf of bread and it lasted longer than the OS did.&nbsp; I know the hardware
     is okay because I repaved with Windows XP and it works fine.&nbsp; I'll give Vista another try later.&nbsp; I really liked the "glass" effects.</li>
