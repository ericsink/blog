<P>The user group meeting was fun.&nbsp; We had a little over a hundred 
people.&nbsp; It's obviously great when people buy one of our products, but 
sometimes it's even better just to see them in person and hear them say that our 
product is cool.</P>
<P>Microsoft's facility in Downers Grove is very nice, especially considering 
that it's very remote from their HQ.&nbsp; The entire place was decked out in 
the usual array of Microsoft banners and posters.</P>

have experienced no problems whatsoever since adopting it about two months 
ago."&nbsp;&nbsp; <EM>Thanks John</EM>.</P>
