<P>About a week ago the hard drive in my ThinkPad died.&nbsp; I spent most of 
the week trying to get back online, in awe of how impaired my life is without 
technology.</P>
<P>Last Monday morning I ordered a new hard drive from IBM.&nbsp; It was in 
stock,&nbsp;so I paid for overnight shipping and expected it to see it by 
10:30am the next day.&nbsp; Tuesday morning came, and the hard drive didn't show 
up.&nbsp; Shockingly, they didn't ship on the same day I ordered.&nbsp; Once I 
calmed down I decided not to sue IBM over this incident, although obviously my 
lawsuit would be more justified than SCO's.</P>
<P>On the bright side, I used the downtime to&nbsp;clean my office.&nbsp; It was 
really a mess.&nbsp; I unpacked some boxes which had been unopened for around 
ten years.&nbsp; I filled most of a dumpster with junk I can't believe I ever 
thought I needed.&nbsp; My office is totally different now.&nbsp; It's like 
having new office space.</P>
<P>Today's trivia question:&nbsp; Not counting the one I use regularly, guess 
how many coffee cups I found when I cleaned out my office?&nbsp; <FONT
