"The original Internet Explorer team was just five or six people. By the time 
Silverberg and others decided to rewrite the browser almost completely for 
version 3.0, released in 1996, the team had grown to 100. By 1999, it was more 
than 1,000."</P>
<P>It's fun reading stories like this from the perspective of a witness.&nbsp; 
Instead of reading to find out what happened, I read it to find out if the 
author got it right.&nbsp; I was there.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>My weblog will remain focused on version control and .NET, but in conjunction 
with the <A href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Conferences/MosaicEvent/">tenth 
anniversary of Mosaic</A>, please indulge me a brief trip down memory lane:</P>
<P>Life in the browser wars was a unique time period for me in my career.&nbsp; 
Spyglass was sort of like my first real job.&nbsp; When I joined the company in 
May 1992 the business was all about scientific data analysis tools.&nbsp; We had 
a little over $3M from <A href="http://www.greylock.com/">Greylock</A> and <A 
href="http://www.venrock.com/">Venrock</A>.&nbsp; It was a fun company, but data 
plotting isn't an explosive growth market.&nbsp; By 1994, everybody was starting 
to realize that.</P>
<P>Management made the decision to transition our business completely and pursue 
the market for web browsers.&nbsp; Tim Krauskopf, the founder and head of 
development, asked me to write a web browser.&nbsp; I started work on Spyglass 
Mosaic on April 5th, 1994.&nbsp; The demo for our first prospective customer was 
already on the calendar in May.</P>
<P>I ended up as the Project Lead for the browser team.&nbsp; Yes, we licensed 
the technology and trademarks from <A href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</A> 
(at the University of Illinois), but we never used any of the code.&nbsp; We 
wrote our browser implementations completely from scratch, on Windows, MacOS, 
and Unix.</P>
<P>We were not the first Mosaic licensee, but we were the last.&nbsp; Prior to 
us, a company called Spry took the Mosaic code and tried to sell "Internet in a 
Box".&nbsp; People still seem to get Spry and Spyglass confused because of the 
similar names.</P>
<P>Netscape didn't even exist yet, but things happened fast.&nbsp; Just a few 
weeks after I started coding, Jim Clark rode into town and gathered a select 
group of programmers from NCSA.&nbsp; Mosaic Communications Corporation was 
born.&nbsp; It was interesting to note that certain people on the NCSA browser 
team were not invited to the special meeting.&nbsp; I can still remember hearing 
about how ticked off they were to be excluded.&nbsp; Champaign-Urbana is a very 
small town.<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Spyglass had the legal right to the "Mosaic" trademark.&nbsp; A few tantrums 
and lots of lawyering later, MCC changed its name to Netscape.</P>
<P>We thought we had a nice head start on Netscape.&nbsp; We had a really 
top-notch team and we moved the rest of our developers over to browser work 
quickly.&nbsp; We were ready to compete with anybody.&nbsp; But Jim Clark was, 
after all, Jim Clark.&nbsp; His SGI-ness knew how to work the advantages of 
being in Silicon Valley.&nbsp; He provided his young company with lots of press 
coverage and very deep pockets.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We decided to approach this market with an OEM business model.&nbsp; Instead 
of selling a browser to end users we&nbsp;developed core technology and sold it 
to corporations who in turn provided it to their end users.&nbsp; We considered 
ourselves to be the arms dealer for the browser wars.&nbsp; Over 120 companies 
licensed Spyglass Mosaic so they could bundle it into their product.&nbsp; Our 
stuff ended up in books, operating systems, ATM machines, set-top boxes, help 
systems, and kiosks.&nbsp; It was an extremely profitable business.&nbsp; The 
company grew fast and ours was one of the first Internet IPOs.</P>
<P>Along the way, we got involved in the standards process.&nbsp; In fact, I 
became the chair of the <A href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</A> HTML Working 
Group for the standardization of <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_toc.html">HTML 2.0</A>.&nbsp; 
I learned a lot through this experience.</P>
<P>In May 1994 I went to the <A href="http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/">first WWW 
conference</A> in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee took me aside and shared his plans for 
a World-Wide Web Consortium.&nbsp; It didn't take too long for the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</A> to become the venue for HTML standards 
discussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually this was A Good Thing.&nbsp; Both Netscape 
and Microsoft became active participants in the W3C HTML Working Group.&nbsp; 
Any group which didn't have their involvement was doomed to irrelevance.</P>
<P>For much of 1994, it seemed like we were ahead of Netscape.&nbsp; Shortly 
after we released our 2.0 version, I remember one of the Netscape developers 
griping about how their schedule had been moved up by six months.&nbsp; We 
smiled because we knew we were the reason.&nbsp; They had not been taking us 
seriously and they were being forced to do so.</P>
<P>But Netscape was running at a much faster pace.&nbsp; They got ahead of us on 
features and they began to give their browser away at no cost to end 
users.&nbsp; This made Netscape the standard by which all other browsers were 
judged.&nbsp; If our browser didn't render something exactly like Netscape, it 
was considered a bug.&nbsp; I hated fixing our browser to make it bug-compatible 
with Netscape even though we had already coded it to "the standard".&nbsp; 
Life's not fair sometimes.<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>We won the Microsoft deal.&nbsp; I suppose only the higher echelons of 
Spyglass management really know the gory details of this negotiation.&nbsp; I 
was asked to be the primary technical contact for Microsoft and their effort to 
integrate our browser into Windows 95.&nbsp; I went to Redmond and worked there 
for a couple of weeks as part of the "Chicago" team.&nbsp; It was fun, but 
weird.&nbsp; They gave me my own office.&nbsp; At dinner time, everyone went to 
the cafeteria for food and then went back to work.&nbsp; On my first night, I 
went back to my hotel at 11:30pm.&nbsp; I was one of the first to leave.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Internet Explorer 2.0 was basically Spyglass Mosaic with not too many 
changes.&nbsp; IE 3.0 was a major upgrade, but still largely based on our 
code.&nbsp; IE 4.0 was closer to a rewrite, but our code was still lingering 
around -- we could tell by the presence of certain esoteric bugs that were 
specific to our layout engine.</P>
<P>Licensing our browser was a huge win for Spyglass.&nbsp; And it was a huge 
loss.&nbsp; We got a loud wake-up call when we tried to schedule&nbsp;our 
second&nbsp;conference for our OEM browser customers.&nbsp; Our customers told 
us they weren't coming because Microsoft was beating them up.&nbsp; The message 
became clear:&nbsp; We sold our browser technology to 120 companies, but one of 
them slaughtered the other 119.</P>
<P>The time between IE 3 and IE 4 was a defining period for Spyglass.&nbsp; It 
was clear that the browser war had become a two-player race.&nbsp; Even with our 
IPO stash, we didn't have the funding to keep up with Netscape.&nbsp; What was 
interesting was the day we learned that Netscape didn't have the funding to keep 
up with Microsoft.</P>
<P>For the development of IE 4.0, a new Program Manager appeared.&nbsp; His name 
was Scott Isaacs and I started seeing him at the HTML standards group 
meetings.&nbsp; At one of those meetings we sat down for a talk which was a 
major turning point for me and for Spyglass.&nbsp; Scott told me that the IE 
team had over 1,000 people.</P>
<P>I was stunned.&nbsp; That was 50 times the size of the Spyglass browser 
team.&nbsp; It was almost as many people as Netscape had in their whole 
company.&nbsp; I could have written the rest of the history of web browsers on 
that day -- no other outcomes were possible.</P>
<P>After that day, it seemed like Spyglass declined fast.&nbsp; The company 
turned its focus on the non-PC browser market.&nbsp; Things shuffled 
around.&nbsp; I left Spyglass in January of 1997 and founded <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">my own company</A>.&nbsp; I left with no 
regrets and no bitterness.&nbsp; Spyglass was an incredible learning experience 
for me.</P>
<P>Looking back on the browser wars, Tim Krauskopf remarked that we had beaten 
everybody who didn't outspend us by a factor of five.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">
