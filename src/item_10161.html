<p>I recently read a good book entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/079318018X/sawdust08-20">You Need 
to Be a Little Crazy</a>&nbsp;by <a href="http://barrymoltz.blogs.com/barryblog/">Barry Moltz</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The subtitle is "The Truth About Starting and Growing Your Business".&nbsp; 
It's a book about entrepreneurship, with lots of good stories.&nbsp; It's not 
specific to software, but&nbsp;the book does contain a fair amount of high-tech 
cluefulness.</p>
<p>Moltz speaks with experience.&nbsp; Although the book includes case studies 
of several other people, the author tells many of his own tales.&nbsp; In fact, 
I think these personal glimpses are&nbsp;the best aspect of the book.&nbsp; 
Somewhat by definition, entrepreneurs&nbsp;are&nbsp;surrounded by people who do 
not truly understand them.&nbsp; Running a small company&nbsp;is therefore one 
of the&nbsp;loneliest&nbsp;jobs in the world, especially because hiding this 
feeling is one of the success criteria.&nbsp; Entrepreneurs need to know they 
are neither alone nor unique.&nbsp; After reading this book,&nbsp;I found myself 
believing that Barry Moltz and I have a lot in common.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed his various postmortem remarks about the dotcom 
bubble, liberally sprinkled throughout the book.&nbsp; Granted, hindsight is 
20/20, so it doesn't take a genius to say that a lot of boneheaded things 
happened in the 1990s.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp;Moltz says it well.</p>
<p>Best of all, the book is just plain fun to read.&nbsp; I devoured the whole 
thing on a plane ride.</p>
