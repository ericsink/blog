<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #16:  The Law of Singularity</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">22 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Singularity says that "in each situation only one move will 
produce substantial results".</P>
<P>We literalists will once again have to endure the authors' word choice.&nbsp; 
The above statement is almost certainly not true.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"></P>
<P>And yet, Ries and Trout make two important points in this chapter, which I 
will paraphrase as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>One bold stroke is much better than a bunch of small marketing efforts. 
  <LI>Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing people.</LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>One Bold Stroke</FONT></P>
<P>The pattern is fairly common.&nbsp; I call it "The Infinite Loop of Marketing 
Despair":</P>
<OL>
  <LI>The product is languishing. 
  <LI>People start asking what to do about it. 
  <LI>Somebody says, "We just need to do more marketing." 
  <LI>The marketing team gets in a conference room and brainstorms. 
  <LI>They come up with ten new ideas and begin executing them all. 
  <LI>Go back to step 1</LI></OL>
<P>Part of the problem here is the assumptions we make about the total result we 
will get from a list of marketing ideas.&nbsp; We make our list in Excel and for 
each item we calculate the results that item will generate for us.&nbsp; And 
then, at the bottom, we enter SUM(B2:B11).&nbsp; This is our mistake.&nbsp; The 
proper estimate for the total result is closer to MAX(B2:B11).&nbsp; </P>
<P>The problem is that awareness-building efforts tend to overlap by reaching 
the same people.&nbsp; We run banner ads.&nbsp; We run magazine ads.&nbsp; The 
same person sees both ads.&nbsp; Is that guy going to buy our product twice just 
because he saw both ads?</P>
<P>The success of our marketing campaigns is&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;the best idea 
on our list, not the length of that list.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we continue to make 
our lists because "Somebody" said we need to do more marketing, and we 
definitely have to make that Somebody feel better.</P>
<P>The way out of this loop is to find something completely different.&nbsp; 
Stop looking for a bunch of ways to increase awareness.&nbsp; Markets are won 
with strategy, not tactics.&nbsp; There is no way you are going to win this war 
by simply doing more of what you are doing now.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Too Important</FONT></P>
<P>Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing people.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The&nbsp;true cause of "The Infinite Loop of Marketing Despair" is Mr. 
Somebody, the guy in step 3 who apparently believes that throwing more money at 
the marketing team will actually solve problems.</P>
<P>In the chapter, Ries and Trout are basically saying that Mr. Somebody is 
"management".&nbsp; They argue that "management can't afford to delegate 
important marketing decisions".</P>
<P>For my purposes, I write for the technical geek.&nbsp; Maybe you're the 
founder of your small ISV.&nbsp; Maybe you're a lead developer who cares about 
the success of your product.&nbsp; Whoever you are, I would encourage you to 
step up and be Mr. Somebody.&nbsp; But don't just push for "more 
marketing".&nbsp; Help your organization find the one bold stroke that will make 
a real difference.</P>
