So VA Linux has just taken the next step, <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/12/07/1253241&mode=thread">changing</a> their name to <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/">VA Software</a>.  I hate to say this, because I've met some cool people at VA, but this company looks like it has definitely <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/">jumped the shark</a>.  I firmly believe that SourceForge can be productized, but it won't support anything close to their current <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/about/executive.php">payroll</a>.  OSDN is not going to give them enough presence to pay for itself through indirect SourceForge sales.  Their <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/sf/roi_calc.php">ROI calculator</a> is just dying to be parodied, but I don't have time.
