<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Mono 0.28</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">02 Oct 2003</span></p>
<P>Congratulations to Miguel and all the Mono developers on the release of <A 
href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.28.html">Mono 0.28</A>.&nbsp; This 
release contains all the work Ximian was doing as part of our agreement with 
them.&nbsp; Working with Miguel and his team was a really positive experience, 
just as I expected it would be.&nbsp; The project had two milestone deadlines 
and they hit them both well ahead of the scheduled dates.</P>
<P>At this point, Ximian has completed 90% of the work necessary to make the <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">Vault</A> command-line client work on 
Linux and its ilk.&nbsp; Now we at SourceGear need to do the remaining 
90%.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
