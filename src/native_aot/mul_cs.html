</p>
<hr/>

<p>Let's walk through a very simplistic example,
a function that multiplies two integers and returns
the result.</p>

<p>Conceptually, that function in C# might look like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
using System;

public static class NativeExports
{
    public static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>But that's not quite sufficient.  Native AOT requires us to
use an <code>UnmanagedCallersOnly</code>  attribute to explicitly identify 
and give names to the entry points we want to export:</p>

<pre class="screen">
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public static class NativeExports
{
    <span style="color: red">[UnmanagedCallersOnly(EntryPoint = "multiply")]</span>
    public static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>What we're saying with the attribute above is that the function known in .NET as <code>NativeExports.Multiply</code> will be exported as a C-compatible function called <code>multiply</code>.  
The function resides in a static class only because C# needs it to, and the name of that class doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Let's remember here that Native AOT doesn't support
reference types.  If one of the function parameters was
of type <code>string</code>, the compiler would complain:</p>

<pre class="screen">
Build FAILED.

...\mul_cs\lib.cs(8,46): error CS8894: Cannot use 'string' as a parameter type 
    on a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'.
</pre>

<p>We'll talk later about how to cope with that.  For now,
we're using integers to keep things simple.</p>

<p>When building for Native AOT, we need to add a <code>PublishAOT</code> property to our csproj file:</p>

<pre class="screen">
&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;

  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net7.0</TargetFramework>
    <span style="color: red">&lt;PublishAOT&gt;True</PublishAOT></span>
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;
</pre>

<p>And that's it.  You can build this as a native library with <code>dotnet publish</code>.</p>

<pre class="screen">
$ dotnet publish
MSBuild version 17.4.1+9a89d02ff for .NET

    for native compilation. Try running dotnet publish with the -r option value 
    specified. [C:\Users\eric\dev\native-aot-samples\mul_cs\mul.csproj]
</pre>

<p>Okay, actually we need one more thing.  Since Native AOT is compiling everything to native code, 
it needs to know the target operating system and CPU at build time.  
We specify this with a RuntimeIdentifier, such as <code>win-x64</code>, <code>linux-arm64</code>.  
(Note, however, that the .NET SDK currently doesn't support Native AOT cross-compilation from one 
OS to another, so <code>dotnet publish -r linux-x64</code> won't work on a Windows host.)</p>

<pre class="screen">
$ dotnet publish -r win-x64

</pre>

<p>Mission accomplished, we have a native dll:</p>

<pre class="screen">
 Directory of C:\Users\eric\dev\native-aot-samples\mul_cs\bin\Debug\net7.0\win-x64\publish

...
01/17/2023  01:18 PM         4,755,968 mul.dll
...
</pre>

<p>WAIT -- it's over 4 megabytes?!?  All it does is multiply two ints!</p>

<p>Yep, that's dreadful, isn't it?</p>

<p>Native AOT involves a certain amount
of overhead.  There are ways to make this tighter, but that's beyond
the scope of this trivial example, so I'll duck the issue for now.</p>

<p>To be fair, we should note that this dll 
is completely standalone, and even at 4+ MB, it is much smaller than a 
full deployment of the .NET runtime and class libraries.
But still.</p>

<p>One thing worth clarifying is that on Windows, native shared libraries use
the same <code>.dll</code> file extension as .NET assemblies, which can be confusing.
One level up from the publish directory, we have another
mul.dll:</p>

<pre class="screen">
 Directory of C:\Users\eric\dev\native-aot-samples\mul_cs\bin\Debug\net7.0\win-x64

...
01/17/2023  01:18 PM             3,584 mul.dll
...
</pre>

<p>But these two mul.dll files are very different.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The mul.dll in the publish directory
        is the native library we've been talking about, the one produced by Native AOT.</p></li>

    <li><p>The smaller one up a level is a .NET assembly.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(And yes, 3,584 bytes is still huge for a function that
multiplies two ints, but keep in mind that .NET assemblies
contain lots of useful metadata that regular native object
files do not.)</p>

<p>Finally, let's try building a static library.  The
dynamic library is the default setting, so in order to
get a <code>.lib</code>, we need to specify the msbuild property <code>NativeLib</code>
with a value of <code>Static</code>:</p>

<pre class="screen">
$ dotnet publish --property NativeLib=Static -r win-x64
MSBuild version 17.4.1+9a89d02ff for .NET
  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored C:\Users\eric\dev\native-aot-samples\mul_cs\mul.csproj (in 98 ms).

  mul -&gt; C:\Users\eric\dev\native-aot-samples\mul_cs\bin\Debug\net7.0\win-x64\publish\
</pre>

<p>Now the publish directory looks like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">
 Directory of C:\Users\eric\dev\native-aot-samples\mul_cs\bin\Debug\net7.0\win-x64\publish

...
01/17/2023  01:42 PM        23,589,176 mul.lib
...
</pre>

<p>Wow -- the static library is even bigger than the DLL!
Yeah, I still don't want to talk about that issue right now.
For the moment, let's just say a lot of stuff is going to get
removed when that .lib meets the linker.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>So, we can package our trivial multiply function as a
native library.
Now we need something to call into that library.  Here is where we
have lots and lots of choices.  The details of calling
native code vary by platform and language.</p>
