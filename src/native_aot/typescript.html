<p>A few weeks ago I published some samples showing the use of
Native AOT libraries from Rust.  As I mentioned, the projection
of .NET APIs to Rust requires quite a few ergonomic compromises.
For example, the following line in C# is a call to the QuestPDF
method to set the size of a page:</p>

<pre class="screen">
    page.Size(PageSizes.Letter);
</pre>

<p>But the Rust projection is messier:</p>

<pre class="screen">
    page.<span style="color: red">Size_PageSize</span>(&amp;PageSizes::get_Letter()<span style="color: red">?</span>)<span style="color: red">?</span>;
</pre>

<ul>
    <li><p>Rust doesn't have method overloading by name, and the <code>Size()</code> method
        has multiple overloads, so we have to give each one its own name, like <code>Size_PageSize()</code>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Rust doesn't have exceptions, and every .NET method might throw, but the metadata doesn't tell us
        anything about which kinds of errors we might want to propagate or not.  So for the
        moment, the binding generator outputs every method with a return type of <code>Result<></code>,
        which means we need to use <code>?</code> after every call.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Rust also lacks other things that .NET wants, including 
optional parameters, property getters/setters, and inheritance.
Because of all these differences, Rust for general .NET development 
would typically involve too much pain to be practical.</p>

<p>But the nice thing about Native AOT libraries, is that
they can be used with anything that can call C.</p>

<h3>Hello TypeScript</h3>

<p>TypeScript has method overloads, exceptions, property getters/setters,
and inheritance.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks, I've been adding
TypeScript as another output language for my 
binding generator.  Things are in a rough state,
but the results look positive, so I have published
a nuget package and a working port of the QuestPDF sample.
That sample is short, but it involves things like generic delegates and
extension methods, so I consider it non-trivial.
</p>

<p>Interop between any two languages will always involve trouble
spots, but TypeScript can look awfully similar to C#.
Here's a visual diff from the Quest PDF sample, with TypeScript on
the left, and C# on the right:</p>

<p><a href="questpdf_diff_ts_cs.png"><img width="750" src="questpdf_diff_ts_cs.png"/></a></p>

<p>All of the differences here are because
I am projecting nullability more strictly 
than it is in C#.  I currently think this is
a feature rather than a bug, but I'm not completely settled
on that, and if I stopped doing it this way, these two
snippets would actually be identical.</p>

<p>To be fair, let's acknowledge that this is just one sample.
TypeScript lacks several things that require extra effort
for .NET interop, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>byref parameters</p></li>
    <li><p>extension methods</p></li>
    <li><p>runtime type information</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, if TypeScript were exactly like C#, it would
be C#.</p>

<p>Still, I see potential here.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The binding generator itself is contained in a nuget package:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SourceGear.Bridge.NativeAOT.TypeScript/0.6.0">https://www.nuget.org/packages/SourceGear.Bridge.NativeAOT.TypeScript/0.6.0</a></p>

<p>The QuestPDF sample is in the <code>samples/typescript</code> directory of this repo:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sourcegear/bridge-info">https://github.com/sourcegear/bridge-info</a></p>

<p>For this prototype, all the FFI-level stuff is setup for Deno (apologies to fans of node).</>

<h3>Related</h3>

<p>There's something going on in the following repo:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/node-api-dotnet">https://github.com/microsoft/node-api-dotnet</a></p>

<p>I'm not super-clear on where that project is headed.
And there are significant differences relative
to what I'm doing, but also some common ground.  I think it looks interesting.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>I'm hoping that I will soon have an AvaloniaUI sample (it's a fair bit more complicated).  Down the road a bit, I'd love to get this working with [at least the desktop versions of] MAUI, but I'm not sure yet what will be feasible.</p>
