      <p><b>Summary</b>: Eric explains the importance of "deep       technology clue" for non-coders in a small ISV.</p>      <p>I just finished making a really difficult technology decision and I       want to tell you the story of what happened. I apologize in advance for       all the gory technology detailsâ€”I promise that I do have a point to make       after I'm done telling my story.</p>      <h2>The Tale of a Technology Decision</h2>      <p>I really want an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> plug-in       for <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">Vault</a>. For several       months I have been trying to figure out the best way to get one.</p>      <p>Our product is and will remain largely focused on the Visual Studio       user, but more and more people are asking us to let them use Vault from       within Eclipse. Developing a Vault client for Eclipse would allow us to       connect with a lot of developers that we currently cannot reach, on       multiple platforms.</p>      <p>However, we have a portability problem. Vault is built entirely in C#.       We don't regret this, but it's not exactly the smoothest path to a       cross-platform strategy. We chose C# to give us other benefits,       consciously accepting the tradeoffs. Vault is a Windows-centric product.       If our highest priority for Vault were support for multiple platforms, we       would have built our product with different technologies. But we didn't,       so now our cross-platform challenges are a bit trickier.</p>      <h3>Defining the boundaries of the problem</h3>      <p>We fully expect that we have to rewrite the UI code for our Eclipse       client. That's okay. We don't expect our UI code to be portable. But it       would be really nice if we didn't have to maintain two copies of our core       client library. This library is called VaultClientOperationsLib, but we       usually just call it "OpsLib" for short. It is the library upon which all       five of our Vault client applications are built. In principle, this 48,000       lines of code should be reasonably portable. It does a lot of file I/O,       some threading and some networking. Nothing here really <i>needs</i> to be       platform-specific.</p>      <p>The first thing we did was to consider and reject three possibilities       that we deem to be unattractive:       </p>
<ul type="disc">        <li><b>Rewrite OpsLib in something more portable.</b>
</li>
</ul>      <blockquote>If this library had been written in C++, then         all of the cross-platform issues would be more straightforward. Tedious,         but straightforward.</blockquote>      <blockquote>But we're simply not willing to do this.         Rewriting OpsLib would require a lot of effort and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">risk</a>,         while providing no value for our current user base, all of whom are         happy using the product on Windows.</blockquote>      <ul type="disc">        <li><b>Port OpsLib to Java and maintain two copies of it.</b>
</li>
</ul>      <blockquote>We could probably port OpsLib to Java in a         month or two.</blockquote>      <blockquote>But we're not willing to do this either.         Maintaining two copies of this library would be far, far too tedious.         Every time we make a change to the C# version we would have to go make         the same change to the Java version.</blockquote>      <ul type="disc">        <li><b>Find a way to call C# from Java.</b>
</li>
</ul>      <blockquote>In a nutshell, the idea is here is to use <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a> to execute our C# code and         create a bunch of glue code that would make the OpsLib API available to         Java. It should be possible for all of the glue code to be automatically         generated, although it might take a little time to work out the       kinks.</blockquote>      <blockquote>This idea isn't actually all that bad, and we         may want to revisit it in the future. But it's not ideal, because it's         not "pure Java". Users will need to install the Mono runtime, which is         large and must be separately compiled for each operating system.         Ideally, we would rather just have a collection of jar files.</blockquote>      <p>So the boundary of the problem looks pretty clear: We want to continue       working in C#, but we somehow want that C# code to "Just Work" on a Java       VM. We like working with the .NET Framework in Visual Studio, but we want       our build system to give us jar files anyway.</p>      <h3>How about a translator?</h3>      <p>The first thing to observe is that C# and Java are remarkably similar.       The syntax isn't all that different, and the runtime libraries have many       similarities. Wouldn't it be cool if we had a translator that would take       our C# source and generate Java source that "Just Worked"?</p>      <p>I personally find this solution very appealing. It has been a <a href="http://www.idiom.com/free-compilers/TOOL/C-24.html">long time</a>,       but I still consider myself a compiler junkie. So I decided to explore the       idea of writing a translator. How difficult could it be? We don't need a       general-purpose translator that can convert any C# program to an       equivalent Java program. We simply need one that is just smart enough to       slurp OpsLib and output a Java equivalent. Furthermore, we control the       input. If we need to make changes to OpsLib to make it friendlier to the       translator, we can do so.</p>      <p>(When facing a similar problem, Fog Creek chose exactly the path I am       describing. Their bug-tracking system is written in ASP. They wrote a       translator that converts from ASP to PHP. Joel's recent <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogBugzIII.html">article</a>       tells the story.)</p>      <p>I started by exploring <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>, a       very cool parser generator that can output C# code. In the end, I found       myself wishing I had a reason to use ANTLR, because I think it's deeply       neato. If I were writing a translator from scratch, I would probably start       here.</p>      <p>But along the way I realized that <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/CSharp_Compiler">mcs</a> (the C#       compiler from the Mono project), would make a much better starting point.       It already has the parser, symbol table, and type system done. I simply       need to make it generate Java source code out the backend instead of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconMicrosoftIntermediateLanguageMSIL.asp">IL</a>       (the Intermediate Language used by the .NET runtime).</p>      <p>So I started hacking. I spent two days adding a new backend for mcs. I       made a remarkable amount of progress, but the experience surfaced a lot of       little problems that we would have to solve. For example, Java methods are       required to declare any exceptions they throw, but C# doesn't need this.       </p>      <p>Eventually we could make this work, but it could take a long time.       Furthermore, it turns out that the syntax conversion is the easy part. The       class libraries are the much bigger challenge. The Java code converted       from C# is still trying to call the .NET Framework, but those libraries       don't exist in the JVM.</p>      <h3>Enter Mainsoft</h3>      <p>In the end, we decided to purchase a solution to this problem from a       company called <a href="http://www.mainsoft.com/">Mainsoft</a>. Their       product, Visual Mainwin for J2EE, happens to do <i>exactly</i> what we       want. (I have no affiliation with this company other than the fact that       SourceGear just became their customer.)</p>      <p>Mainsoft's tool is a Visual Studio add-on which compiles C# to Java       byte code instead of to IL. They include a class library that provides       support for .NET Framework stuff.</p>      <p>I was ultra-skeptical, but in practice, this tool is working       surprisingly well. We had to make very few changes to the OpsLib code, all       fairly minor. The resulting Java version of OpsLib passes our suite of       regression tests, and that speaks volumes about the quality of work       Mainsoft has done. Those tests are truly sadistic.</p>      <p>In the end, we've got a pure Java solution, nothing but a collection of       jar files. We can run them on Windows or on Linux.</p>      <p>By purchasing Mainsoft's product, we allow ourselves to keep our       primary focus on Vault itself. That's a big win.</p>      <p>The tradeoff is that this product was very expensive. The license       agreement contains confidentiality clauses which prohibit me from       disclosing the price. Suffice it to say that this product is not cheap.</p>      <p>But the money is now spent, and the decision is behind us. Now I can       get back to working on other things, not the least of which is writing       this article, which is now several days late.</p>      <p>Okay, I promised I would make a point, and it is high time that I did       so, but first I want to indulge in just one more digression. Unless you       are the CEO of Mainsoft, feel free to skip the following section.</p>      <h2>Some Unsolicited Advice for Mainsoft</h2>      <blockquote>Dear Mainsoft,</blockquote>      <blockquote>Your technology is so cool that it seems like         magic, but your company has a bug which I think is worth fixing: You are         too focused on the Enterprise tier.</blockquote>      <blockquote>I use Microsoft's terminology when I describe         the various tiers in the developer market. Your company seems to be         completely optimized for the "Enterprise" tier. I understand why, as it         is obvious that your products are a good fit there.</blockquote>      <blockquote>The tier just below that is called the         "Professional" tier. Your current approach makes it very difficult for         you to sell your cool product(s) to people in this tier. Personally, I         think it would be worthwhile for you to learn how to relate to         Professional tier developers like me.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Don't get me wrongâ€”your service to SourceGear         has been quite adequate. Surprisingly, your <a href="/bos/Closing_the_Gap_Part_1.html">sales         guy</a> was actually <i>not</i> a complete annoyance, and for those of         us here in the Professional tier, that's all we really want from a sales         guy. I would also like to compliment you on the excellent technical         support service we have received. When we found a bug, your team         responded quickly and provided us with a fix.</blockquote>      <blockquote>But if you want to reach the Professional         developer tier effectively, I think you need some new tricks:</blockquote>      <blockquote>Â· You need to be more <a href="/bos/Transparency.html">transparent</a>.         You are one of the most opaque software companies I have ever seen. A         lot of the developers in the Professional tier are active members of a         broad community of .NET developers. You'll have to learn how to relate         to that community if you want to sell your product to these       people.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Â· You need to develop a "Professional" Edition         of your product. Your current version of the product should henceforth         be called the "Enterprise Edition". For the "Pro" version, introduce         some carefully chosen limitations that would make it unattractive to         Enterprise customers. Perhaps you can find a few features to remove that         will not render the product too crippled for use by ISVs and other         Professional tier developers.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Â· Finally, the licensing and pricing terms for         the Pro version need to be very different from what you are using       now.</blockquote>      <blockquote>I encourage you to look closely at these         possibilities. There may be enough revenue in the Professional tier to         be worth your trouble.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Kinds regards, Eric</blockquote>      <h2>"Fine Eric, so what's your point?"</h2>      <p>My point is simply this: Virtually all decisions in a small ISV should       be made with the involvement of technology person. Most decisions in a       small ISV involve issues of both technology and money. These decisions are       really hard. </p>      <p>Note that I am not claiming my decision in the story above was       absolutely the right one. I've made my share of mistakes in this arena,       and I'm sure I will make more. Only time will tell if my decision turns       out to be something we will regret.</p>      <p>But here's the thing: I cannot imagine facing a decision like this one       without the depth of technology understanding that I have. </p>      <p>I am not comparing my level of 'technical clue' to other geeks. I am       merely saying that relative to a non-programmer or a person with a pure       business background, I am an absolute wizard on matters of technology:       </p>
<ul type="disc">        <li>I understand the technical abstractions involved in architectures         like .NET or Java.
</li>
<li>I have a pretty good idea of how painful it would be to maintain two         copies of our core client libraries.
</li>
<li>I don't have to wonder how difficult it would be to write a         C#-to-Java translator. I can hack for a couple of days and prototype         one.
</li>
<li>I know that <b>String.Format()</b> has no counterpart in the Java         class libraries, and I know about how long it might take me to write         one.
</li>
<li>I know that Java has no unsigned types, and I know what Mainsoft had         to do in order to get around this problem.
</li>
</ul>      <p>The decision I made above is a classic example of a "build vs. buy"       problem. This kind of decision happens quite frequently in the course of       running a software company, but it's still just one example of a decision       that involves both technology and money. Such decisions happen all the       time at many different levels of management. Getting them right is really,       really hard, even for people who can see through all the technology       abstractions. When such decisions are made without this expertise, the       chances of a good result go way down.</p>      <p>People like to wonder why software companies fail. This is one of the       big reasons why.</p>      <p>Most ISVs are founded by a developer. They all begin as       developer-centric companies. But sometimes they lose their way as they       grow. Somebody convinces them to hire "real management". More and more       decisions involve money, and developer involvement in those decisions       gradually decreases. Suddenly you find yourself in a big mess.</p>      <p>Company growth necessarily involves growing pains. In a software       company, the central challenge of that growth is blending new leadership       (people with real management experience) with old leadership (people who       understand the technology of the product).</p>      <h2>"So you're saying that developers are the only people who       are valuable?"</h2>      <p>Absolutely not. In fact, my primary worry as I write this       three-thousand-word rant is that I will trigger a wave of even higher       arrogance among the programmers of the world.</p>      <p>Fellow Geeks, we must strive for excellence not only in our code, but       also in our interactions with Those Who Think HTML is a Programming       Language. Drawing from a piece of our own wisdom literature, let us not       forget the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes">memorable       words</a> of Han Solo:</p>      <blockquote>Don't get cocky!</blockquote>      <p>Software developers have a horrible tendency to think they are the most       important people in every company. Unfortunately this particular delusion       of grandeur has some truth to it, so many of us find it terribly difficult       to behave and get along with others.</p>      <p>Nonetheless, my point remains true. The skills of a developer are       applicable to many other tasks besides coding:       </p>
<ul type="disc">        <li>As a customer service person, a developer who understands how the         product works can find problems faster.
</li>
<li>As a sales guy, a developer who understands how the product works         can more easily answer questions about what is possible.
</li>
<li>As a marketing person, a developer can help with decisions where         technology choices affect market strategy.
</li>
</ul>      <p>Companies should not be afraid to let developers get involved in       activities other than software construction.</p>      <p>Developers should work very hard to remember that the world does not       revolve around them. Without exception, all of the most successful       developers I know have a posture of humility.</p>      <h2>"But aren't developers missing some skills?"</h2>      <p>Absolutely. As developers, we are often just not qualified to       participate in things like sales or marketing or strategy. We can be too       abrasive to talk with customers. We love certain technologies too much to       be objective. We forget that users are very different from us. </p>      <p>Nonetheless, companies must find a way to give our 'technology       cluefulness' a voice in the discussion of decisions.</p>      <p>I love reading the various essays written by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>. Just as a novelist       reveals more about his character with each chapter, Paul keeps refining       his characterization of the "Great Hacker" with each piece that he writes.       After reading his complete works, it is easy to see two things:       </p>
<ul type="disc">        <li>The wisdom of the Great Hacker is absolutely essential in         decision-making.
</li>
<li>With his complete inability to find pragmatic compromise, the Great         Hacker is such a royal pain in the $%@*&amp; that nobody ever wants to         ask for his input.
</li>
</ul>      <p>In contrast, I just love this little gem that was recently posted on       Joel Spolsky's discussion site by somebody who calls himself/herself       "comp.lang.c refugee":</p>      <blockquote>Programming languages are chosen mainly for         business reasons. I spend most of my time working with languages that I         don't really like because the languages that I'd like to work with carry         business disadvantages that outweigh their technical merits. That's the         nature of the game. I can accept the situation (my choice) or find a new         employer. Whining about how I can't use Java or Python or whatever at         work just isn't an option.</blockquote>      <p>Fellow developers, if we expect to be heard, we must learn some       balance. </p>      <h2>"Geeks everywhere? Where does this madness stop?"</h2>      <p>It doesn'tâ€”it goes all the way to the top. </p>      <p>In a software company, there are very few positions where 'technical       clue' is not an asset. From the lowly summer intern all the way up to the       CEO, a person with deep technical understanding can add more value than       the same person without. Joel Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Stupidity.html">said it</a>       this way:</p>      <blockquote>If you ask <i>me</i>, and I'm biased, <i>no         software company can succeed</i> unless there is a programmer at the         helm.</blockquote>      <p>I am inclined to agree.</p>      <h2>"But... but... what about Steve Ballmer?"</h2>      <p>Is Microsoft an exception to my rule? I can't say. Some Microsofties       say that Bill Gates occasionally walks into the office of a random       developer and instantly understands the code at a deep level. Others claim       that Bill is 7 feet tall and can shoot lightening from his fingertips.       I've never worked there, so I don't really know if all the legends are       true.</p>      <p>But I have long believed that Bill's deep technology expertise has been       a critical factor in the success of Microsoft. Bill presided over the       ascent of Microsoft to its incredible levels of success. I cite Microsoft       as an example of my claims, not as a counterexample.</p>      <p>But I still think it is fair game to ask if Microsoft is losing some of       its developer-centric foundations now that Steve is the CEO, as long as we       remember two things:</p>      <p>First, Bill is still very, very involved.</p>      <p>Second, Steve may not be a programmer, but there's a geek inside him       that wants to come out. I checked Steve's background and discovered he has       a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/default.asp">Harvard       math degree</a>. More importantly, a little Web searching easily reveals       the hilarious video of him dancing around the stage chanting, "Developers!       Developers! Developers!" This guy is no pretty boy CEO (examples of which       my editor would immediately delete, so I won't even try). Strictly       speaking, this guy may not be one of us, but I'm inclined to trust him.</p>      <p>That said, I still can't resist offering:</p>      <h2>Some Unsolicited Advice for Steve Ballmer</h2>      <blockquote>Dear Steve,</blockquote>      <blockquote>I just bet that you periodically ask yourself         the following two questions:</blockquote>      <blockquote>Â· Has Microsoft become less developer-centric         since I took over as CEO?</blockquote>      <blockquote>Â· Should it?</blockquote>      <blockquote>I honestly don't know the answer to either of         these questions. Like any great company, Microsoft is constantly         changing, evolving, and maturing in an industry that moves very       quickly.</blockquote>      <blockquote>But if you ever get the impression that the         hardcore developers need more voice in the company, I have a suggestion         for you: Get Microsoft to formalize a well understood career path for         developers to move into <a href="/Marketing_for_Geeks.html">marketing</a>.</blockquote>      <blockquote>In my opinion, Microsoft is already the         industry leader in helping developers apply their skills in other areas.         You guys created the idea of a "Program Manager," a developer who writes         specs instead of code. As another example, I think of the SDET (Software         Development Engineer in Test), a developer who writes testing code         instead of product code.</blockquote>      <blockquote>I am simply suggesting that you develop a         similarly well-understood way for developers to apply their         understanding of software architecture and construction to the         challenges of product strategy. Microsoft would benefit, and many other         companies would benefit. The rest of the industry tends to follow your         lead on things like this.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Have a nice day, Eric</blockquote>      <h2>Back to the Matter at Hand</h2>      <p>OK, let's take a step back and review. I just gave unsolicited and       probably clueless advice to the 24<sup>th</sup> richest man in the world.       I can't shake the feeling that this article took a wrong turn somewhere.       I'll try to get back on track here just before I wrap things up.</p>      <p>Perhaps the best way to end this article is with a few remarks about       what this all means for the micro-ISV. The following is an example of one       of the most common questions I get from developers who are creating a       brand new software company:</p>      <blockquote>Where can I find a partner to be a co-founder         and handle the business side of things?</blockquote>      <p>My answer: Don't.</p>      <p>It is common to see software companies starting out with two founders,       a geek and an MBA. Do you really need the MBA?</p>      <p>If I were to oversimplify the message of this article, I would make two       statements:       </p>
<ol type="1">        <li>Developers add more value to a software company than anybody else.
</li>
<li>The truth of statement 1 is inversely correlated with the size of         the company.
</li>
</ol>      <p>When a company is very small or just getting started, nobody can add       value as well as a developer because there isn't really much other stuff       that needs to be done. You don't have customers yet.</p>      <p>Yes, there are obviously a number of non-coding things that have to be       done, but those things are a part-time job. You don't need a full timer,       and certainly not a co-founder, and most certainly not one with an MBA.       </p>      <p>Do all that stuff yourself. You need the experience anyway. If you       really want a partner, don't find an MBA, find another geek like yourself.       Don't be afraid to allow your company to be very developer-centric for a       very long time. By doing it this way, you'll avoid a lot of problems and       you'll learn a lot.</p>      <p>      </p>
