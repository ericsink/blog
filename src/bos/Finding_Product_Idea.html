teaser: You are a geek. You think about technologies first. You see a cool new platform and try to think of a way to use it. You discover the Opacity property in Windows Forms and you start trying to think of ways to apply it. If you are not already using the .NET Framework, you are frustrated, because everybody else is talking about how cool it is.

      <p><b>Summary</b>: Eric describes a series of steps to help find       a good product idea for starting a micro-ISV.      </p>
<h2>Jump on the Micro-ISV Bandwagon!</h2>      <p>In the September edition of this column, I wrote about something I call       a "micro-ISV", a software product company with just one person in it.       Since then, this concept seems to have struck a chord with many readers.       I've seen lots of discussion among people who want to take the plunge and       create their own micro-ISV.</p>      <p>I'm not saying that you're going to see the term "micro-ISV" on the       cover of <i>Newsweek</i> anytime soon, but I'm still surprised at the       amount of momentum I see. I coined this term rather flippantly, never       considering the possibility that it might resonate so well with developers       who feel the entrepreneurial urge. For this reason, I never even thought       about the idea of registering the <a href="http://www.microisv.com/">microisv.com</a> domain name. Luckily,       someone else did, and a community of micro-ISVs is growing there.</p>      <h2>Letters. I get letters.</h2>      <p>I get lots of e-mail from micro-ISV "wannabes". They send me all kinds       of questions in the mistaken belief that I have all the answers. One of       the most common questions is from folks who want to know how to find a       good product idea. People love the concept of building and selling a       software product in their basement, but they don't know what product to       build and sell.</p>      <p>Good product ideas are a strange thing. When you want a product idea       and do not have one, ideas can seem be very elusive. The search for a good       product idea can be very frustrating. Later, when you are busy and       focused, good ideas tend to show up frequently.</p>      <p>This article is a "how-to" on finding a product idea for a micro-ISV.       goal is to help you make this process as systematic as possible. In fact,       I'm going to provide an algorithm you can use to find product ideas.</p>      <h2>The Algorithm for Finding an Idea</h2>      <p>Many entrepreneurs search for a product idea using an algorithm that       looks something like this:</p>
<p style="BORDER-RIGHT: #d1d7dc 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d1d7dc 1px solid; FONT-SIZE: xx-small; BORDER-LEFT: #d1d7dc 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d1d7dc 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Courier, 'Courier New', sans-serif; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fafafa">
Idea FindGoodProductIdea()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;Idea candidateIdea = null;<br />
&nbsp;while (true)<br />
&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;candidateIdea = new Idea();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( candidateIdea.IsGood() )<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;return candidateIdea;<br />
}<br />
</p>      <p>This algorithm frankly doesn't work well at all, for three reasons:       </p>
<ul type="disc">        <li>It's inefficient. Every time through the loop, your brain has to         make a context switch between being creative and being analytical. These         context switches waste a lot of your mental CPU time and slow you down.
</li>
<li>It generates too few results. The context switches prevent you from         ever getting a really good flow of ideas.
</li>
<li>It's buggy. This algorithm forces you to evaluate every product idea         in isolation. Sometimes an idea doesn't reveal its potential or its         pitfalls until you've had plenty of time to think about it.
</li>
</ul>      <p>Using the algorithm above is the best way to not find an idea or to       settle on a bad one. A much better algorithm looks something like this:</p>
<p style="BORDER-RIGHT: #d1d7dc 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d1d7dc 1px solid; FONT-SIZE: xx-small; BORDER-LEFT: #d1d7dc 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d1d7dc 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Courier, 'Courier New', sans-serif; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fafafa">
Idea FindGoodProductIdea()<br />{<br />&nbsp;ArrayList candidateList = BrainstormLotsOfIdeas();<br />&nbsp;return ChooseTheBestIdea(candidateList);<br />}<br />
</p>      <p>In this approach, you will spend a lot of time upfront building a list       of ideas. This is the step where you apply creativity, thinking with an       open mind and diverging into all possibilities.</p>      <p>After that, you spend a lot of time choosing the best idea from your       list, thinking more analytically and converging onto the one idea that is       the best fit for the kind of micro-ISV you want to build.</p>      <h2>Build a List of Ideas</h2>      <p>Get yourself a notebook and a pen. You're going to be writing down       every possible idea you can think of. You need at least dozens, if not       scores, of candidate ideas from which you will select the best one.</p>      <p>You don't have to build your entire list in a single session. In fact,       it's probably better if you approach this exercise in a more leisurely       fashion. Build your list over a couple of weeks, spending a little time       each day.</p>      <p>The process of generating this list is called <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=brainstorming">brainstorming</a>       and the key concept is "flow". You're trying to get a river of ideas       flowing as fast as your pen can write them down. </p>      <p>The most important rule of brainstorming is to <b>not</b> evaluate the       ideas as you go. Write down every idea you get, no matter how lame it       sounds. Don't stop to think about the size of the market or the difficulty       of implementation or the strength of the competition. Stopping to critique       the ideas interrupts the flow. Furthermore, first impressions of a product       idea are often very deceptive. Good ideas can sound stupid at first, while       stupid ideas often seem very attractive. Just write down every idea and       start thinking of another one. Once the flow starts, don't stop it.</p>      <p>So how do you get this idea flow started? Here are a few tips:</p>      <h3>Think about problems, not technologies</h3>      <p>Finding a product idea will probably require you to think exactly the       opposite of the way you usually think. You need to focus on problems to be       solved, not on technologies to be applied. </p>      <p>You are a geek. You think about technologies first. You see a cool new       platform and try to think of a way to use it. You discover the       <b>Opacity</b> property in Windows Forms and you start trying to think of       ways to apply it. If you are not already using the .NET Framework, you are       frustrated, because everybody else is talking about how cool it is.</p>      <p>You probably won't find a good software product idea until you stop       thinking so much about software. Instead, think about problems that need       to be solved. Then, think about how software could be used to solve       them.</p>      <h3>Think about your other interests</h3>      <p>Most software is being used to solve a problem that is unrelated to       software. In fact, many software products are focused on a specific       industry. We call these markets "vertical".</p>      <p>You are probably more familiar with "horizontal" products such as       Microsoft Office or <a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/">Quickbooks</a>. These products are       mainstream and applicable "across" many different kinds of businesses.</p>      <p>There are lots of vertical products that you've probably never heard       of. Software to manage a furniture store or a golf course doesn't get much       mainstream attention. However, there are great opportunities in vertical       markets. Everybody is using computers today, so there are a lot of needs       to be met. </p>      <p>Even better, the competitive landscape in vertical markets is a lot       less hostile. Vertical niches are usually served by small companies like       yours. Enormous companies like Microsoft and Oracle usually don't consider       these little market segments to be worth the trouble.</p>      <p>The real problem with verticals is that you need to know a lot about       the field into which you want to sell. Since you are a software developer,       the strong likelihood is that you know a heckuva lot about software and       not very much at all about real estate or automotive repair or classroom       management. It's probably not a good idea for you to dive into a vertical       market about which you know nothing.</p>      <p>However, if you do have knowledge in a non-software field, think hard       about the problems in that field that need to be solved. Even if your       non-technical interests are merely a hobby, you should be thinking of how       a software product might fit. As a woodworker, I frequently think of ideas       for software products that the hobbyist woodworker might like. Experience       in non-technical topics can be a great source of ideas for your list.</p>      <h3>Get more inputs</h3>      <p>If you find that your brain isn't generating enough ideas, perhaps you       need something to spark your creativity a bit. In other words, to get more       outputs, you need more inputs. You need something to get you thinking       about things you don't usually think about. You need to get yourself out       of your usual routine.</p>      <p>Grab your notebook and go to the mall. Walk around and look. Ignore the       17-year-olds with low-rise jeans. Focus on the stores and the products       they have for sale. Think about the people that buy those products. Do       they have a computer? What kinds of problems might be solved with that       computer?</p>      <p>Repeat the above exercise, only this time, instead of walking through a       mall, take a virtual walk through the yellow pages section of your phone       book. Think about all the companies you see. What software could make it       easier for these companies to function?</p>      <p>These walks are simply a way of sparking some different thinking.       You'll see everything from eyeglasses to pretzels to lawnmowers. Who knows       what ideas might come to your mind? Don't forget to write them all       down.</p>      <h3>Get other people to help</h3>      <p>Brainstorming works better with multiple people. Ask a friend or family       member to help think of ideas for your list. Ask them what they wish their       computer could do differently.</p>      <p>Do you know anyone who owns a small business? A teacher? A college       student? A homemaker? Ask each of them what they want their computers to       do to make their lives or jobs easier.</p>      <h3>Remember the remora</h3>      <p>A remora is a fish that attaches itself to the side of a larger       creature like a whale or a shark. The remora doesn't actually do any work       to find food. It relies on the bigger fish to handle the real marketing       challenges and cleans up the opportunities left over. The remora reminds       us that micro-ISVs can do very well with an add-on product.</p>      <p>An add-on product is a companion software product to some other       software product. The other product (which I will call the "host       application") is usually larger and more popular. The add-on product rides       the popularity of the host application. For example, an Adobe Photoshop       plug-in is an add-on product.</p>      <p>The strategy for add-on products is very different from other       scenarios. You are using the host application as part of your platform,       just like the operating system or runtime libraries. People who don't use       the host application will have no interest at all in your add-on product.       Your potential customer base is entirely constrained by the set of people       who are users of the whale to which your remora will be attached. For this       reason, it is important that you select a very large whale.</p>      <p>Despite the fact that your maximum market is so clearly defined and       limited, add-on products often sell very well. Users like add-on products       because they can get a problem solved without changing the way they do       things. Just as its name implies, an add-on product is purely additive,       subtracting nothing from the way the user already works.</p>      <p>As an example, consider QuickBooks, probably the most popular       accounting application for small businesses. Let us suppose you discover       that QuickBooks is missing a feature that lots of people want. If you want       a strategy that is doomed to failure, then build your own accounting       application from scratch and include the missing feature. On the other       hand, if you want a much smarter approach, create an add-on product to       help QuickBooks users deal with the deficiency.</p>      <p>To include add-on products on your list of candidate product ideas,       you'll need to execute a special subroutine. The pseudo-code looks       something like this:       </p>
<ol type="1">        <li>Make a list of really popular products.
</li>
<li>For each of these host applications:         <ol type="a">          <li>Use Google to search for people who are whining about some missing           feature or deficiency.
</li>
<li>Think of an add-on product to address their complaint.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>      <p>The sheer volume of whining on the Internet usually makes it easy to       quickly fill your candidate list with add-on product ideas.</p>      <h2>Evaluate the Ideas and Pick One</h2>      <p>Once you've got a list of ideas you can start thinking critically about       them. Which ideas sound plausible? Which ones sound absurd? Which ones       sound like fun? Which one is the best?</p>      <p>You need to ask yourself some difficult questions about each idea.       Below, I have included a number of questions you should ask as you try to       figure out how good each product idea really is. These are just examples       of the <i>kind</i> of questions you should ask. Don't be afraid to come up       with questions of your own.</p>      <p>Also, don't just ask <i>yourself</i> these questions. Find some other       people to ask as well. Choosing a product idea entirely by yourself is a       really bad approach. There is a substantial risk that you will fall in       love with one of your ideas and find yourself blinded to risks and       problems that show up later. Get the opinion of somebody else who is       objective and who will not be involved with your new business. In fact,       it's a good idea to get multiple opinions. </p>      <p>You don't have to heed every piece of advice you solicit, but do try to       objectively consider each tidbit of feedback you receive. This means you       need to have a thick skin. Somebody is going to tell you that your idea is       lame, whether it is or not. You can't logically analyze your decision if       you get your feelings hurt.</p>      <h3>Suggested questions</h3>      <h4>Will you use this product yourself?</h4>      <blockquote>Life is easier if you are developing a product         that you actually use. As a user of your own software, you will never be         out of touch with its problems.</blockquote>      <h4>Does this product meet a need?</h4>      <blockquote>Entrepreneurs often want to develop games. And         why not? After all, games are fun. Shouldn't we enjoy life?</blockquote>      <blockquote>Lots of software people do make a living in         games, but this kind of situation is just very different. Don't forget         that computer games are also called "entertainment software". The key         word here is <i>entertainment</i>. Developing a popular game is a         process which is roughly as predictable as developing a popular rock         band.</blockquote>      <blockquote>If you can make a living developing games,         please accept my congratulations and my envy. In my opinion, it is         easier to sell software that solves a problem. </blockquote>      <h4>Who are the competitors?</h4>      <blockquote>You need to identify your competitors and         study them. Search the Internet and dig up everything you can find. How         long have they been in business? Are they profitable? Do they have         investors? How many employees do they have? How much do they spend on         advertising? For public companies, this information is easy to find. For         private companies, just make a guess.</blockquote>      <blockquote>If you can't find any competitors at all, <a href="/Choose_Your_Competition.html">be         afraid</a>. This is usually a very bad sign. It means that your product         might not actually have any market at all.</blockquote>      <h4>What is your differentiation?</h4>      <blockquote>How will your product be different from the         ones already available from your competition? The people who care about         this difference are your target niche. The most important factor in         evaluating the potential success of a product idea is a clear         description of a target niche that needs your product.</blockquote>      <blockquote>How many of these people are there? How much         will they pay for your product? How can you make sure they know about         your product?</blockquote>      <blockquote>Another fast and sure way to fail is to enter         a market with established competition, telling yourself that you can get         5% market share even though your product is similar to the others. You         <i>must</i> identify a market <a href="/Positioning.html">position</a> you         can pursue.</blockquote>      <h4>How long will it take to build the product?</h4>      <blockquote>It's important to pick a product idea that is         about the right size for a micro-ISV. You're going to be all by         yourself. Realistically, some product ideas are simply too       big.</blockquote>      <blockquote>You also want to get to market as quickly as         possible. How many months will you need to build version 1.0 of your         product? It is usually better to keep the 1.0 feature set as small as         possible so you can get your product out in the market sooner. If you         can't get a sellable 1.0 out the door within six months or so, look         carefully before you leap.</blockquote>      <blockquote>One of my own personal favorite product ideas         has this problem. The market position is good, and I know the product         would sell. But it would probably require around two years of full-time         effort before I could release version 1.0. That's a long time to wait         for the first dollar of revenue and the first real customer       feedback.</blockquote>      <h4>Does this product require a sales guy?</h4>      <blockquote>The ideal product for a micro-ISV can be sold         entirely online to customers who pay with a credit card. You are         one-person company, and you don't have a support staff.</blockquote>      <blockquote>For consumer markets, if your product idea         cannot succeed without shelf space at Wal-Mart, you should probably find         another idea. Getting something into that kind of channel is going to be         very difficult for a micro-ISV.</blockquote>      <blockquote>For corporate markets, if your product idea         cannot succeed without a <a href="/bos/Closing_the_Gap_Part_1.html">sales         guy</a>, you should probably find another idea. Get your micro-ISV         established before you even think about adding more staff. </blockquote>      <blockquote>By the way, it's important to realize that         this sales guy issue affects your pricing decisions as well. Corporate         buyers have limits. If you exceed these limits, they need lots of         approvals from their superiors, which means you need a sales guy to hold         their hand throughout the process. Avoid these limits (and the sales         guy) by keeping your product price under $1,000, preferably under       $500.</blockquote>      <h4>How much technical support will be required?</h4>      <blockquote>As a micro-ISV, you are responsible for all         technical support. Unless you eventually plan to expand your company         with new hires, all of the time you spend supporting your customers is         time you are not spending on development of new features. Keep this         balance in mind as you analyze a product idea.</blockquote>      <h4>Do the numbers work?</h4>      <blockquote>Estimate the revenue you will get from a         product. This is the hardest part of the analysis. A full discussion of         revenue projections would be far too long for this article. For now,         suffice it to say that your guesses are probably not as bad as you       think.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Is the revenue enough to meet whatever your         financial goal is? For example, if you want to go full-time in your         micro-ISV, how many sales do you need each month to pay your bills? How         realistic is it to get that much revenue?</blockquote>      <h3>Special questions for add-on products</h3>      <p>As I mentioned above, add-on products involve a different strategy, so       they need their own set of special questions as well:</p>      <h4>How will you integrate with the host application?</h4>      <blockquote>Add-on products are rather difficult if you         can't find a place to connect. Does the host application have an API you         can use? An open network protocol? A documented file format? Your         customers want the most seamless and integrated experience you can         deliver.</blockquote>      <h4>Can you get marketing help from the vendor of the host       application?</h4>      <blockquote>The vendor of the host application owns the         entire market for your product. They know all of their customers. The         dream scenario is for that vendor to market your product to their         customers.</blockquote>      <blockquote>Keep in mind that the big vendor has very         little incentive to help you. However, nothing you do in marketing can         be as effective as what they can do on your behalf, so you might as well         ask. Perhaps they would be willing to announce your product in their         newsletter? Perhaps they might be persuaded to put a link on their Web         site? Don't be too surprised if they say "no", but don't be afraid to         ask more than once.</blockquote>      <h4>Will I find myself competing with the larger vendor?</h4>      <blockquote>The obvious risk of an add-on product is the         possibility that the vendor of the host application will incorporate the         feature that your add-on was designed to address. Think about this risk         as you analyze the potential for your add-on product.</blockquote>      <h3>Narrowing the field</h3>      <p>The geek in you would probably like to have a purely quantitative       method for determining which product idea is best. Wouldn't that be great?       Assign every idea a simple numerical score and do a sort. Barring a tie,       the top idea is the one to choose.</p>      <p>If you happen to work out just such a formula, let me know. However, in       my experience, things aren't so simple. No easy formula can accurately       measure the "goodness" of any product idea.</p>      <p>Instead of ranking all the ideas and choosing the best one, make       several iterations over your list, and remove some of the candidates each       time.</p>      <p>If you did a good job during the brainstorming phase, your list       probably contains some ideas that are really stupid. That's okay. Try to       keep an open mind about every idea on your list. There isn't much risk       that you will actually settle on a truly horrible idea, so why not let       them all linger around until you're sure? I've made good money on ideas       that sounded absurd to me at first.</p>      <p>Nonetheless, the first iterations might go very quickly. Some of the       ideas can probably be eliminated without much analysis. If you are       wondering whether to try and build a new SQL database to compete with       Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM, I hope you can resolve that quandary quite       expeditiously.</p>      <p>Your last iteration should be a decision between the two or three best       ideas on your list. Don't make the final decision too quickly. Take the       time you need to find every useful piece of information you need.</p>      <h2>Your Next Steps</h2>      <p>Let us suppose that you have followed all the steps described in this       article and you still have not identified a good product idea.</p>      <p>The truth is that my so-called algorithm is not a panacea. In fact, I       use the word "algorithm" in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion.       Entrepreneurship and marketing are very complex. These topics can be       simplified and systematized only so far. As I said at the top of this       piece, my goal is to make this process "as systematic as possible", but       the result is probably "still not very systematic at all". Starting a       micro-ISV requires a whole bunch of ingredients. Nothing I write can       compensate for a critical ingredient that is missing.</p>      <p>On the other hand, perhaps you have found your idea and are ready to       go. That's great news! Proceed with courage and caution, and with this one       final piece of advice:</p>      <p>Never forget that your idea is worthless without you. There are       probably nine other people on the planet who are thinking about the same       idea right now. The only question is which one of you is actually going to       make it happen.</p>      <p>      </p>
