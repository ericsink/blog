<p>The following articles originally appeared on the MSDN website.  From October 2003 to April 2005, I wrote a column there called "The Business of Software".  Thanks to <a href="https://sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sells</a> for giving me the opportunity to write for MSDN, and to Maurine Bryan for doing a great job with the editing.</p>
