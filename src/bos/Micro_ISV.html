      <p><b>Summary</b>: Eric examines the world of micro-ISVs, which 
      are software companies that are comprised of only one person.</p>
      <p>In most of my writings I am talking about a particular type of software 
      company, which I refer to as a "small ISV". I daresay most of my readers 
      know what I mean by this term, but I'd like to take a moment to define 
      it.</p>
      <p>The word "ISV" is an acronym that stands for Independent Software 
      Vendor. An ISV is a software company that creates and sells software 
      products. 
      </p>
<ul type="disc">
        <li>Consulting shops are not ISVs, although an ISV may do consulting 
        work.
</li>
<li>Value-added resellers are not ISVs, although an ISV may certainly 
        resell stuff from somebody else.
</li>
<li>In an ISV, you have to envision the product you want to build and 
        take a risk that somebody will still want to buy it by the time you get 
        it built.
</li>
<li>If you don't have a software product, you are not an ISV.
</li>
</ul>
      <p>The adjective "small" carries some specific connotations. I'm thinking 
      of a company with less than 50 employees. The company is funded by its own 
      revenues and has not accepted investment from a venture capitalist. The 
      company was founded by a geek who tends to have his or her hands in lots 
      of different job functions.</p>
      <p>But just how "small" can a small ISV be? It turns out that lots of 
      software products are created by companies made up of exactly one person. 
      Those tiny companies are the focus of this article. Some might call them 
      "indie" software developers. For now, I'm calling them "micro-ISVs".</p>
      <h2>A Force of One</h2>
      <p>I am fascinated by the notion of a software product company with just 
      one person in it. In part, this is because many small ISVs start out with 
      just one person and grow organically from there.</p>
      <p>But lots of software endeavors never grow beyond their founder. We 
      might not think of these companies as successful, but in many cases we 
      should. I can name several examples of micro-ISVs whose accomplishments I 
      admire.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="http://nick.typepad.com/">Nick 
        Bradbury</a> is well-known to many as the author of Homesite, which he 
        sold to Allaire. Today he sells TopStyle, a CSS (cascading style sheet) 
        editor for Web geeks, and FeedDemon, an RSS (really simple syndication) 
        aggregator. I've heard lots of people express their respect for Nick. I 
        had the pleasure of meeting him at Gnomedex last year.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><a href="http://www.guiffy.com/">Bill 
        Ritcher</a> sells Guiffy, a diff/merge tool for software developers. 
        Since Bill does business in the same general area as SourceGear, I've 
        enjoyed the opportunity to talk with him on several occasions. I've seen 
        plenty of indications that his product is quite successful.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><a href="http://www.dexterity.com/">Steve 
        Pavlina</a> sells a variety of different games. I've never met him, but 
        he seems to be one of the more highly respected "indie" developers. His 
        Web site contains a number of excellent <a href="http://www.dexterity.com/articles/">articles</a> he has written on 
        topics relevant to small ISVs.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><a href="http://www.asharewarelife.com/">Thomas Warfield</a> sells Pretty 
        Good Solitaire, a game that supports over 600 different variants of 
        single-person card games. As far as I can tell, his product is the most 
        successful of all the solitaire games out there. In a presentation from 
        a recent conference, Warfield <a href="http://www.asharewarelife.com/bootcamp/page9.html">hints</a> that 
        his efforts have made him a millionaire. Strangely enough, I have never 
        met Thomas, even though he lives not far from me. <i>Thomas, if you read 
        this article, I am hereby offering to come over to Springfield and buy 
        you lunch.</i></blockquote>
      <p>As far as I can tell, all of these guys are making a nice living for 
      themselves by selling software products in a company with (essentially) 
      one person. Many of us would not find it intuitive to aspire to be a 
      single-person software company. Still, companies like these are 
      fascinating to me. Some founders of micro-ISVs are making big bucks, even 
      as they maintain a lifestyle that allows them to lead a very balanced 
      life.</p>
      <h2>Shareware</h2>
      <p>In my study of single-person software companies, I keep bumping into 
      the word "shareware". I observe that there is a strong community of people 
      who use the word "shareware" to describe their products. This community is 
      alive and thriving. CNN even did an <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/06/18/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm">article</a> 
      on shareware a few months ago. Nonetheless, I'm not sure everybody inside 
      the community agrees on a clear definition of the word "shareware", much 
      less those outside the community.</p>
      <h3>First Impressions</h3>
      <p>I first heard the word shareware perhaps fifteen years ago. Based on 
      those experiences, if you were to ask me to define what shareware means, I 
      would have said that shareware is freely distributable software for which 
      payment is voluntary.</p>
      <p>I would also have said that nobody makes a living doing shareware 
      full-time. One person I remember from that era is Rich Siegel, the author 
      of BBEdit, who made the following remarks in a USENET posting in May 
      1992:</p>
      <blockquote><i>It's possible to achieve fame by releasing 
        shareware or freeware, but never fortune. Anything that shareware brings 
        in is strictly pocket change to me.</i></blockquote>
      <p>One of the shareware apps I recall from that era is a Macintosh text 
      editor called <a href="http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/">Alpha</a>. I'm not 
      sure if Pete Keleher would remember me, but I do remember him. It is great 
      to see that Alpha is still available and is still shareware. However, as 
      far as I can tell, Alpha has never been a full-time job for Pete. Even if 
      his pile of "pocket change" is quite tall, Alpha is something he does on 
      the side, in addition to his primary vocation.</p>
      <h3>Today</h3>
      <p>The world of shareware seems very different now. The shareware 
      community has a trade organization called the <a href="http://www.asp-shareware.org/">Association of Shareware 
      Professionals</a>. They also have an annual gathering called the <a href="http://www.sic.org/">Shareware Industry Conference</a>. </p>
      <p>As I said, I'm not sure there is a truly clear definition of the word 
      shareware, but it does seem that the meaning of the word has evolved over 
      the years. For example, some products are described as shareware even 
      though payment is not voluntary. "Demo" versions with certain limitations 
      have replaced the past practices of relying solely on guilt and shame to 
      elicit revenue.</p>
      <p>The Association of Shareware Professionals seems to <a href="http://www.asp-shareware.org/users/about-shareware.asp">define</a> 
      shareware as "try-before-you-buy software". Given that virtually all 
      software companies now offer a downloadable demo, this definition would 
      seem to mean that all software is shareware. In essence, it appears that 
      the shareware community has chosen to define its boundaries very broadly, 
      allowing the community to welcome any software vendor that wants to join 
      it.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, not all software vendors want to describe their products 
      using that word. Like it or not, for many people the word shareware 
      carries connotations of something that is "amateurish" or 
      "unprofessional". Even as some companies wear this word as a badge of 
      pride, others avoid it for fear that it will scare away corporate 
      customers.</p>
      <h3>A Trophy</h3>
      <p>I find it terribly ironic that while I was in the process of writing 
      this article, the postman showed up at SourceGear and delivered a trophy. 
      It turns out that on July 17th at the Shareware Industry Conference, the 
      2004 Shareware Industry Award winners were announced. Although we didn't 
      even realize that our product was nominated, SourceGear Vault (our source 
      control system) won the award for "Best Application Using .NET".</p>
      <p>I'll confess that we had mixed reactions over this award. About seventy 
      percent of our reaction was very positive. We are grateful and flattered. 
      It is always nice to win. The people who voted for us obviously appreciate 
      the work we have done.</p>
      <p>The other thirty percent of our reaction involves concern and 
      confusion. We don't consider Vault to be shareware. Like I said, some 
      people have negative impressions of what this word means. Will people who 
      are afraid of shareware be scared away from Vault simply because of this 
      award?</p>
      <h3>A rose by any other name... </h3>
      <p>In the end, I have concluded that I don't care what the term 
      "shareware" means or what connotations it may have. Here at SourceGear, we 
      will continue to choose not to use the term to describe our products, but 
      I maintain my respect for the accomplishments of those who do. The fact is 
      that the shareware community contains a lot of micro-ISVs that are doing 
      some very impressive things.</p>
      <p>For more information about the shareware community, I recommend the 
      following links:</p>
      <p>The Association of Shareware Professionals has several interesting 
      pages, including a <a href="http://www.asp-shareware.org/users/history-of-shareware.asp">history 
      of shareware</a>.</p>
      <p>Among the excellent articles on Steve Pavlina's site, I really enjoyed 
      <a href="http://www.dexterity.com/articles/shareware-amateurs-vs-shareware-professionals.htm">this 
      one</a> on the difference between amateurs and professionals.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot of interesting information about the shareware 
      community from an eBook entitled, <a href="http://swb2.com/">Shareware 
      Business Blunders</a> by Adam Stiles.</p>
      <h2>My Problem</h2>
      <p>Getting back to the subject at hand, whether or not a company describes 
      its products as "shareware", I remain intrigued by the concept of 
      single-person software product companies.</p>
      <p>However, the more I examine micro-ISVs, the more I realize that I just 
      don't understand them. I want to write about how to start and run a 
      micro-ISV, but I don't really have any experience from which I can speak. 
      I've never worked in a one-person software product company.</p>
      <p>I have come to the conclusion that I will not really understand this 
      world until I spend some time in it.</p>
      <p>Besides, I feel somewhat excluded from the party when my column is 
      compared to the others here on MSDN. All the other columns on MSDN are 
      technical, so naturally they have sample code. My column is on the 
      business of software, so what I need is not sample code, but rather, a 
      sample <i>product</i>. :-)</p>
      <h2>Introducing: Winnable Solitaire</h2>
      <p>Call me crazy, but I have decided to enter the market for desktop 
      solitaire games. I like to play the solitaire game that ships with 
      Windows, but I wish it would tell me whether or not each deal is winnable. 
      In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a solitaire game that has this 
      feature. I want to play traditional solitaire, but I want the luck removed 
      from the equation.</p>
      <p>So I created a solitaire game that has the one feature I have always 
      wanted. Winnable Solitaire is very simple. It allows the user to play 
      traditional solitaire, often called Klondike, just like the sol.exe that 
      comes with Windows. My version has just one feature that makes it 
      different: Every deal is winnable. My app changes solitaire from a game of 
      luck to a game of skill.</p>
      <p>I am primarily doing this product as an experiment, but the product is 
      still very real. I'm selling it to real people and I'm charging real money 
      for it. You can check out <a href="http://solitaire.ericsink.com/">my 
      product Web site</a>.</p>
      <p>Like I said, this is an experiment. I want to gather some data. I'm 
      trying to learn about the kind of software products that can happen in a 
      micro-ISV. </p>
      <p>Not only is this an experiment, it is an open one. I plan to disclose 
      all of my findings. In future postings on my weblog, I will share my sales 
      figures, my costs, and my stories.</p>
      <p>As I write this, I really don't know how much money I will make on this 
      product. There are approximately 500 million computers on the planet. My 
      product could be a success if I sold it to a minuscule fraction of that 
      market. I am expecting the sales to start slow and grow slow.</p>
      <h2>Hypotheses</h2>
      <p>The following sections contain guidelines for getting started with a 
      one-person company. These are things I believe to be true about micro-ISV 
      product development. If I were writing from experience, I would refer to 
      these items as advice. Instead, these are hypotheses that I hope to 
      verify.</p>
      <h3>Don't start too big</h3>
      <p>I like to dream up product ideas. Unfortunately, most of them seem like 
      things that would require 12-24 months of development before I see my 
      first dollar of revenue. That kind of plan is a lousy way to get started. 
      The risks of a new venture can be dramatically reduced if that problem can 
      be avoided.</p>
      <p>In any software company, it's important to find a way to keep your 1.0 
      cycle as short as possible while still building a product which will 
      generate revenue. This is a delicate balancing act, I admit. If your 1.0 
      release is light on features, fewer people will buy it. If you build the 
      product that will appeal to the bulk of your market, it will take too 
      long. Where's the happy medium?</p>
      <p>Most companies err on the side of putting too much into the 1.0 
      release. We just can't resist fighting a feature war with our competitor. 
      We convince ourselves that we have to beat the other guy on features or 
      nobody will buy our product. </p>
      <p>Thomas Warfield's solitaire game has 600 different variants. If I 
      believed in feature wars I would be unable to ship my 1.0 release until I 
      had 601 variants. That's crazy. The purpose of 1.0 is to help pay for the 
      development of 2.0, and so on.</p>
      <p>I started the development of Winnable Solitaire on June 16th. One month 
      later, on July 16th, the app was complete and of sufficient quality to be 
      shipped. The point here is not to brag about how fast I am as a coder, 
      although I'll confess I was feeling rather smug on the 16th of July. The 
      real point here is that I chose a 1.0 product with an extremely tight 
      focus.</p>
      <h3>Don't quit your day job yet</h3>
      <p>I wrote Winnable Solitaire during my spare time. I sometimes like to 
      write code late at night after my kids are in bed and the house is 
      quiet.</p>
      <p>During the day, I continued my usual responsibilities at SourceGear. In 
      fact, for the sake of reassuring the SourceGear customers who might be 
      reading this note, please understand that I am committed to my day job. 
      Winnable Solitaire is purely a side project. I wrote this app specifically 
      so that I could write articles like this one, to encourage software 
      entrepreneurs. This is neither a job change for me nor is it a strategy 
      change for SourceGear.</p>
      <p>My point here is that it is possible to get a micro-ISV started while 
      keeping your day job. Here again, the key is keeping a very tight focus 
      for your 1.0 release.</p>
      <p>By the way, you may want to be sure you don't accidentally find 
      yourself in a legal tussle with your employer. If you have an employment 
      agreement, read it carefully. Some employers hold the opinion that any 
      software you create while you are an employee is their property, even if 
      you do it off-hours and off-premises. Whether the employer is right or 
      not, you don't want to find yourself in a disagreement after the fact.</p>
      <p>As it happens, this situation applies to me. My deal with SourceGear 
      says that the company owns any software I create while I am employed here, 
      regardless of the circumstances. So although Winnable Solitaire is 
      certainly not a SourceGear product, any revenues I receive will end up 
      getting turned over to SourceGear. Obviously that's okay with me, since I 
      am one of the owners of SourceGear anyway. However, I recommend you check 
      your situation and make sure you know what you are getting into.</p>
      <h3>Don't fake the plural</h3>
      <p>I don't think micro-ISVs should try to hide the fact that there is only 
      one person in the building. Conventional wisdom says that even a 
      one-person company should use the word "we", but I think it often ends up 
      looking silly.</p>
      <p>This seems particularly true today in a world where weblogs have become 
      so popular. More than ever before, companies like to see a glimpse of the 
      person behind the product. The result is that a lot of one-person 
      companies are speaking in the first-person plural while a lot of larger 
      companies are speaking in the first-person singular. Doesn't this seem 
      kind of weird?</p>
      <h3>Don't forget the Law of Focus</h3>
      <p>Being careful to remind my readers that I do admire Thomas Warfield and 
      his accomplishments with Pretty Good Solitaire, I must disagree with him 
      when <a href="http://www.asharewarelife.com/bootcamp/page1.html">he 
      says</a>, "Marketing is the process of communicating with other people to 
      get them to give you their money in exchange for your product." </p>
      <p>I admit that lots of people do define marketing that way. 
      Unfortunately, that definition is only half of what marketing really 
      is.</p>
      <p>Marketing has <a href="/Marketing_for_Geeks.html">two 
      parts</a>: strategy and communications. We pay more attention to marketing 
      communications (aka "marcomm") because it's more visible. It is also more 
      expensive. But it is not more effective.</p>
      <p>Readers of my weblog know that I really like <a href="/laws/Immutable_Laws_Marketing.html">The 
      22 Immutable Laws of Marketing</a>, by Al Ries and Jack Trout. One of the 
      more challenging chapters of that book, <a href="/laws/Law_05.html">Law#5: The Law of 
      Focus</a>, says that "the most powerful concept in marketing is owning a 
      word in the prospect's mind". The concept seems intuitive until you try to 
      narrow things down to just one word. When asked to tell someone how great 
      our product is, most of us want to say several things, not just one.</p>
      <p>With Winnable Solitaire, I want to own the word "winnable" in the mind 
      of the market. That's the only attribute I'm seeking to own.</p>
      <p>Don't underestimate the power of the Law of Focus. Your target market 
      has a very short attention span. You probably have time to say only one 
      thing. Choose that one thing very carefully.</p>
      <h3>Don't spend much on advertising</h3>
      <p>I have often claimed that small ISVs don't need to do much advertising. 
      For Winnable Solitaire, I'm going to stay true to my philosophy. My 
      advertising budget will be quite minimal, but not zero. I have placed an 
      <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/">AdWords</a> ad on Google. For 
      now, that is basically my entire advertising strategy for this 
product.</p>
      <p>If Winnable Solitaire ends up being a success, it will be due to the 
      power of differentiation. Obviously, my solitaire game is not "better" 
      than its competitors. I have only one differentiating feature. My only 
      customers will be those people who are willing to pay a few bucks for that 
      feature.</p>
      <h3>Don't hassle your users</h3>
      <p>For this one, I'm going out on a limb. I believe that customers today 
      are so tired of being annoyed by spam and sales guys that they will 
      appreciate a no-hassle purchase.</p>
      <p>My <a href="https://store.sourcegear.com/solstore/(yoamhtrgaybvsf45mgqjgin5)/Default.aspx">registration 
      form</a> allows customers to remain anonymous. I obviously do need their 
      credit card information, but I discard it immediately after the sale is 
      complete. I also ask for buyers to tell me the countries and states in 
      which they live, so that I can keep some simple statistics about where my 
      sales are happening. </p>
      <p>I don't ask for an e-mail address, so my customers don't need to worry 
      about spam. I don't ask for any contact information at all, so my 
      customers don't need to worry about me trying to sell them more stuff. I 
      literally have no idea who is buying my product.</p>
      <p>I am making a tradeoff here, and I am honestly not sure it is the right 
      one. Conventional wisdom says I should grab customer contact information 
      so that I can specifically target my customers with new products and 
      upgrades and newsletters and books and T-shirts and socks.</p>
      <p>As part of my experiment, I've decided to trade that away. Customers 
      don't like being targeted. I want to see how much goodwill I can earn by 
      <a href="/bos/Closing_the_Gap_Part_2.html">letting 
      my customers be in charge</a>.</p>
      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>I reserve the right to tweak my strategy and tactics over time. I plan 
      for this to be an ongoing, long-term experiment. Whether the product 
      succeeds or fails, I hope to learn something, and I hope the stories about 
      this journey are interesting enough to read.</p>
      <p>Starting out, my micro-ISV is facing ridiculous odds: 
      </p>
<ul>
        <li>My product competes with something that is freely included with 
        every copy of Windows.
</li>
<li>I make no secret of the fact my company is just me, and I only work 
        on this during my spare time.
</li>
<li>My marcomm budget is minimal.
</li>
<li>I have consciously chosen not to build a customer list.
</li>
<li>The competing products in this market are well-known, mature, and 
        have far more features.
</li>
</ul>
      <p>Common sense would say that my product is doomed. Stay tuned and we'll 
      find out.</p>
