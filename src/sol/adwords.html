<p>Google keeps killing my ad.</p>
<p>I just want my ad to show up whenever somebody searches on the word "solitaire".</p>
<p>My first problem was that the ad got disapproved because "solitaire" is a trademarked term in France and Monaco.&nbsp; It took a couple of days to get that silliness resolved.</p>
<p>When my ad finally started, I got several hundred clickthrus.&nbsp; The clickthru rate (CTR) looked like it was just fine.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the ad was disabled for reasons of inadequate CTR.&nbsp; If my CTR was actually too low, this would make sense, but that didn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Still digging...</p>
