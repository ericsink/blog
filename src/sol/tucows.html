<p>Yesterday I submitted Winnable Solitaire to <a href="http://www.tucows.com/">Tucows</a>.&nbsp; I had never used Tucows before, so this has been a learning experience all its own.&nbsp; I decided to pay the $65 to expedite the review and approval of my app.&nbsp; They said the queue was about 49 days long if I didn't pay to be moved to the front of the line, although I have no way of verifying this obviously self-serving claim.</p>
<p>The Tucows reviewer gave me a rating of 3 cows out of 5.&nbsp; I'm not sure, but I don't think that's a very good review.&nbsp; They are reasonably specific about their review guidelines, so I assume that I would need to specifically tailor the app to get more cows.&nbsp; I'll add that task to my list of "things to do in my copious spare time".</p>
<p>I just checked their site and my app is now <a href="http://providenet.games.tucows.com/preview/375063.html">visible</a>.&nbsp; It is supposed to show up highlighted in their What's New section on Wednesday.</p>
