<h2>Winnable Solitaire</h2>
<P><a href="http://solitaire.ericsink.com/">Winnable Solitaire</a> was my pet project, an entry into the world of "indie" game development.
Readers will note that I now speak of this project in the past tense.  I may work
on Winnable Solitaire again in the future, but for now it is clear that my day
job keeps me sufficiently busy.  I haven't had time for indie game development
in a long time.
