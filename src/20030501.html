<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Q:&nbsp; What's the difference between 
buying magazine ads and setting dollar bills on fire?</P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">A:&nbsp; Flaming cash actually produces a 
benefit, since it generates heat.</P>
<P>Magazines offer the most traditional form of advertising.&nbsp; The model is 
simple:&nbsp; Content is the hook which brings readers.&nbsp; Advertisers pay to 
have their commercial message intermingled with the content.&nbsp; However, 
there are two big problems with print advertising for a small ISV:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>It's very expensive. <BR><BR>
  <LI>It generates a benefit which is intangible and impossible to measure with 
  any precision or accuracy.</LI></UL>
<P>Some will claim that you <EM>have</EM> to advertise if you want to 
succeed.&nbsp; <A href="http://us.imdb.com/Quotes?0068098">Horse 
hockey</A>.&nbsp; Succeeding as a small&nbsp;ISV&nbsp;is about&nbsp;choosing 
what kind of mistakes you want to make.&nbsp; You can safely make plenty of 
mistakes as long as you don't make any of the fatal ones.&nbsp; If you can't 
afford it, spending too much on advertising is a <EM>big</EM> mistake.&nbsp; On 
the other hand, if you don't advertise when you should, that's probably a 
<EM>small</EM> mistake.&nbsp; Which of these mistakes has the greater potential 
to be fatal?</P>
<P>For most small ISVs, print advertising is just not an appropriate use of 
funds.&nbsp; For example, a full page color ad in a major software development 
magazine will cost over $10,000.&nbsp; How many copies of your product would you 
have to sell in order to pay for that ad?&nbsp; Frankly, ten thousand lottery 
tickets might be a better investment.</P>
<P>Despite all my advice to the contrary, sometimes you <EM>should</EM> do print 
advertising.&nbsp; We do.&nbsp; People are more likely to remember and recognize 
you if they have repeated impressions from a regularly appearing&nbsp;ad.&nbsp; 
In the sections below I will pass along some of the things we have learned over 
the years.&nbsp; But remember:&nbsp; You don't have to feel guilty or 
unprofessional if you choose not to run magazine ads.&nbsp; You can always start 
later.</P>
<P>In the end, if you&nbsp;just can't decide whether to run magazine ads, flip a 
coin.&nbsp; If it comes up "heads", 16 times in a row, then you should be 
spending more money on print advertising.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>By the way, choosing not to run print ads doesn't mean you can't 
advertise.&nbsp; Online advertising is a much better way to get started.&nbsp; 
Regardless of how small your company is, you should be advertising on <A 
href="http://www.google.com/ads/">Google</A>.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Guidelines for Getting 
Started</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>Start small</STRONG>.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>You don't need to be running full-page ads right from the start.&nbsp; It's 
  much cheaper to run 1/4 page or 1/3 page stuff.&nbsp; In fact, sometimes these 
  ads actually get more attention because they will share their page with the 
  content of an article.</P>
  <P>Also, you should start out by running your ads every-other-month instead of 
  every month.&nbsp; It's an easy way to cut your cost in half and still get 
  repeated impressions over time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Keep the ad simple</STRONG>.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Don't try to squeeze your whole data sheet into a 1/4 page ad.&nbsp; Nobody 
  will read all that stuff anyway.&nbsp; Your ad should have plenty of empty 
  space in it, and it should deliver one very simple message.&nbsp; The reader 
  will spend less than one second looking at your ad.&nbsp; What do want them to 
  see?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Don't hire an agency</STRONG>.&nbsp; </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Hiring a marketing firm is a terribly expensive way to go.&nbsp; These 
  firms will try to get deeply involved in your company.&nbsp; They want to help 
  you with marketing strategy, tactics, and execution.&nbsp; Their goal is to 
  weave themselves into the tapestry of your firm so that it will be difficult 
  to remove them later.&nbsp; Often these firms do excellent work, but the cost 
  can be incredibly high.&nbsp; You can get excellent results with a 
  Do-It-Yourself approach.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Do hire a graphic designer</STRONG>.&nbsp; </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Running an ugly ad is worse than nothing at all.&nbsp; You probably need to 
  find a freelancer to help.&nbsp; Find someone who is a Photoshop expert.&nbsp; 
  Find someone with the ability to create designs which are nice-looking and 
  clean.&nbsp; Ask to see their work.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>Before you commit, tell them you expect to own full copyright on the 
  results and you expect them to give you the&nbsp;original Photoshop file, not 
  just the&nbsp;GIF/JPG/PNG versions.&nbsp; By holding on to the PSD file, the 
  designer is trying to lock you in and prevent you from making minor changes 
  yourself.&nbsp; This is like buying custom software and getting compiled 
  binaries instead of source code.</P>
  <P>At SourceGear we've worked with quite a few designers over the years, 
  ranging from $20/hour up to $80/hour.&nbsp; In a large metro area the rates 
  are probably higher.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>"Boring" is bad</STRONG>.&nbsp; </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Ad space is expensive so you really need to use it wisely.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately, most people don't.&nbsp; Pick up your favorite computer-related 
  magazine and browse the ads.&nbsp; Isn't it amazing how unimpressive some of 
  them are?</P>
  <P>I admire ads with just the right amount of creativity, ads with a clever 
  but subtle sense of humor.&nbsp; Check out <A 
  href="realbasic_ad.jpg">this ad</A> I saw a few 
  months ago for <A href="http://www.realbasic.com/">REALbasic</A>.&nbsp; I 
  suppose this is on borderline of being cheesy, but I laughed, and I remembered 
  their message.&nbsp; Sometimes an ad can't do much better than that.</P>
  <P>It's worth the time to brainstorm and try to come up with a creative 
  idea.&nbsp; Good ideas can come from anywhere, but you have to spend time 
  throwing spaghetti against the wall in order to find out what sticks.&nbsp; 
  Gather everyone in your company and agree to just spew ideas without stopping 
  to really critique them.&nbsp; It will take a little while to get things 
  flowing.&nbsp; Eventually the idea flow will slow to a trickle.&nbsp; Then 
  it's time to start sifting the good ones from the bad ones.</P>
  <P>If you really want to ignore my advice, you can hire a marketing firm to do 
  this.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; Brainstorming marketing ideas is fun.&nbsp; Why 
  should you pay them $200 per hour to do fun stuff while you sit alone trying 
  to find a memory leak?</P>
  <P>I hope you don't mind a little shameless tooting of our own horn:&nbsp; 
  Here at SourceGear, we're rather proud of our latest marketing 
  effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're promoting <A 
  href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</A> as if it were a 
  movie.&nbsp; We produced a short "trailer" <A 
  href="http://VaultTheMovie.com/">video</A> and we're running magazine ads 
  which resemble a <A href="vault_ad.gif">movie 
  poster</A>.&nbsp; The packaging for our product is in the style of a movie 
  DVD.&nbsp; We've got full-sized movie posters as well.&nbsp; Several people 
  have told us that it the best marketing campaign they've ever seen for a 
  software product.&nbsp;<EM><FONT size=2> (Kudos to Scott Boesch, the guy at 
  SourceGear who made this campaign happen.)</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>But "cheesy" is much worse.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Not everyone is creative.&nbsp; Sometimes when we try to be clever we 
  actually end up with something dumb or trite.&nbsp; If you can't find 
  an&nbsp;idea with a little bit of subtle cleverness, just run an ad with a 
  simple, professional message.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Choosing Where to Place Your 
Ad</FONT></P>
<P>As a small ISV, your whole marketing approach should be targeted at one "very 
small, very focused niche".&nbsp; Choosing a magazine for your ads is simply a 
matter of figuring out what those people are reading.</P>
<P>By the way, you do have a "very small, very focused niche", right?&nbsp; If 
you're thinking about advertising now, you should have figured this part out a 
long time ago.&nbsp; Before you even get started building a product, you need to 
describe that people who you want to buy it.&nbsp; The biggest and most common 
marketing mistake is aiming for too big of a market.&nbsp; It's 
counterintuitive, but the way to succeed is to find a very small group of people 
and make sure those people love your product.&nbsp; Tackle larger markets after 
you win small ones.&nbsp; Walk before you run.</P>
<P>So, if you are thinking that you need a magazine with enormously wide 
distribution, that's a symptom that you don't <EM>really</EM> have a target 
niche.&nbsp; Magazines like Newsweek and Sports Illustrated are completely out 
of the question, and the prices might astonish you.&nbsp; For example, the 
inside front cover spread for Sports Illustrated is over $500,000 per 
issue.&nbsp; Marketing to the mass consumer market is a scary world, and you 
don't want to play there.&nbsp; Even magazines like PC World are probably too 
broad for a small ISV.&nbsp; You need to find a magazine with a readership of 
less than 100,000 people, many of which are in your target niche.</P>
<P>In all likelihood, you will find several magazines which are appropriate for 
your target niche.&nbsp; You need to narrow the list down to just one, maybe 
two.&nbsp; Your next step involves talking to one of the magazine's ad sales 
people.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Ad Sales People</FONT></P>
<P>Magazine ads are sold by sales people.&nbsp; Their job is to convince you to 
buy ads.&nbsp; More specifically, their job is to convince you that everything 
I'm saying in this article is not true.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>A good advertising sales person can be very convincing.&nbsp; They know that 
advertising is really just black magic, so they try to convince you otherwise by 
spreading a thin veneer of science over everything.&nbsp; They will show up with 
all kinds of data and statistics.&nbsp; They will have studies and surveys and 
charts and tables which describe the demographics of 
their&nbsp;readership.&nbsp; By the end of their presentation, you will be 
hypnotized, ready to give them all your money.&nbsp; Try to resist.&nbsp; Once 
they leave the room, the spell will be broken.</P>
<P>One way or another, you need lots of information to make a good decision:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Ask the magazine how many readers&nbsp;they&nbsp;have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure 
  to also ask if their&nbsp;circulation figures are&nbsp;"audited" by an 
  independent third-party firm.&nbsp; If their numbers are not audited, they 
  might have just made them up.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Ask the magazine to describe their readers.&nbsp; Make sure you ask them 
  this question <EM>before</EM> you describe your target niche to them.&nbsp; If 
  you tell them who you are trying to reach, they will simply paraphrase it back 
  to you and claim that their readership is exactly the right fit for your 
  promotional needs.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> <BR><BR>
  <LI>Call a few people in your niche and ask them their opinion of the 
  magazine.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Get several issues of the magazine and study the ads:<BR><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>Are any of your competitors advertising there?&nbsp; If somebody else is 
    trying to reach the same niche by advertising in this magazine, then maybe 
    you need to be there too.<BR><BR>
    <LI>How big are the companies advertising in this magazine?&nbsp; If all the 
    companies advertising in this magazine are much larger than yours, this may 
    not be the right place for you to be.&nbsp; Huge companies don't always need 
    a "very small, very focused niche".&nbsp; They can afford to market their 
    image alone, like those funny TV commercials you see from IBM.&nbsp; If a 
    magazine is only selling ads to really big companies, their readership may 
    not be as targeted as you would like.<BR><BR>
    <LI>Count&nbsp;the "house ads".&nbsp; When a magazine fails to sell ad 
    space, they usually run a "house ad", an advertisement for their own 
    magazine, or one of their sister magazines, or an event they are 
    sponsoring.&nbsp; For example, the December 2002 issue of .NET magazine has 
    an ad for Visual Studio magazine on the inside back cover.&nbsp; That's a 
    house ad.&nbsp; Both these magazines are run by Fawcette.&nbsp; If&nbsp;a 
    magazine&nbsp;issue&nbsp;has lots of house ads, that means the magazine is 
    having trouble selling ad space.&nbsp; Like a house that's been sitting on 
    the market for too long, you should wonder why you should want to be there 
    when nobody else does.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>SourceGear is a developer tools company so there are lots of good places to 
run our ads.&nbsp; Our products are generally Windows-centric, so we are in <A 
href="http://www.fawcette.com/vsm/">Visual Studio Magazine</A> and <A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/">MSDN</A>.&nbsp; We're considering <A 
href="http://www.code-magazine.com/">CoDe</A>, but haven't actually placed any 
ads there yet.&nbsp; We're also interested in <A 
href="http://www.sdtimes.com/">SD Times</A>, which is targeted more at 
management and describes itself as more of a newspaper than a magazine.&nbsp; 
For now we are staying away from magazines like <A 
href="http://www.ddj.com/">Dr. Dobb's</A>.&nbsp; It's a fine magazine and quite 
popular, but our dollars are better spent right now in places which have a more 
Windows-centric readership.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Buying the Ad</FONT></P>
<P>Your sales person will quote your rates using a "rate card", which is nothing 
more than a pricing chart.&nbsp; Some magazines actually publish their rate card 
online.&nbsp; By doing a Google search on the keywords "rate card" I found 
a&nbsp;few examples:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.marketing.pcworld.com/site/print_rates.html">PC 
World</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.business2.com/business2/0,,12168,00.html">Business 
2.0</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.fawcette.com/mediakit/magazines/vsm/rates/">Visual Studio 
Magazine</A></P>
<P>Obviously, the bigger the ad, the more expensive it is.&nbsp; Note that 
special placements cost extra.&nbsp; For example, the back cover ("cover 4") is 
often the most expensive ad in the magazine.&nbsp; For just over a hundred 
thousand dollars, you can buy the back cover of PC World magazine, or a three 
bedroom home in central Illinois.</P>
<P>The pricing on the rate card is sometimes negotiable.&nbsp; You might as well 
try.&nbsp; Even if they won't reduce the price, ask them to throw in some 
freebies.&nbsp; For example, they might give you some free online web ads if you 
buy their print ads.&nbsp; We never buy ads without asking for 
something&nbsp;we're not supposed to get.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>Ad&nbsp;pricing is structured to encourage you to make long 
commitments.&nbsp; If you only want to place an ad one time, you will pay full 
price.&nbsp; If you sign a contract for six insertions, you can get a price 
break on a per-insertion basis.&nbsp; On the rate card this is called a "6X" 
rate.&nbsp; An even bigger discount comes when you commit to place your ad in 
every issue they publish for a full year (or longer).&nbsp; This is usually a 
12X rate, but can be even more if magazines do special issues in between their 
regular monthly edition.</P>
<P>SourceGear is on a 14X contract with Visual Studio Magazine right now.&nbsp; 
That means we've promised to place a full page ad in every issue for 2003, 
including their 2 special issues.&nbsp; A contract this long can get painful if 
you change your mind later or if cash gets tight.&nbsp; Don't sign a full-year 
contract the first time you place a magazine ad.</P>
<P>A contract can be cancelled but you'll have to pay them a&nbsp;"short rate" 
penalty.&nbsp; Basically, they won't let you run 6 insertions at a 12X 
rate.&nbsp; If you sign a 12X contract and quit after 6,&nbsp;you'll 
have&nbsp;to retroactively pay the 6X rate, and perhaps a little more for their 
trouble.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>What Happens After Your Ad 
Runs</FONT></P>
<P>Most people try to measure the effectiveness of their ads.&nbsp; I admit that 
it's nice to hear from someone who saw your ad, but I took too many college 
science classes to actually believe there is any real data to be found.&nbsp; 
Remember plotting data in your physics class?&nbsp; A data graph is meaningless 
without the error bars.&nbsp; Unless you know the precision of your data, it's 
pretty hard to draw solid conclusions.</P>
<P>No matter how hard someone tries to convince you otherwise, marketing is not 
science.&nbsp; If you drew a graph of the response rate to a magazine ad, the 
error bars would be off the ends of the axes.&nbsp; We simply can't measure ad 
effectiveness with any precision at all.</P>
<P>Finally, be advised that the magazine ad sales people are reading each 
other's magazines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you place your first ad, you are on 
everybody's radar screen.&nbsp; Expect to get calls from the sales people at 
every other magazine in the market.</P>
