title: Just how big is that 'big empty office' ?

<P><A 
href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/c76a4a81-6bac-420d-8267-5c9cbdd29729">Korby 
says</A> Microsoft is seeking to hire a <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=e9cc47e9-8983-4f30-a3b0-5eea6826333d">Development 
Lead for Microsoft Visual SourceSafe</A>.&nbsp; I checked the actual job posting 
and I don't see any strict requirement saying that the applicant must be an 
<EM>individual</EM>.&nbsp; Consequently, SourceGear has informed me that she 
would like to apply for this job.</P>
<P>SourceGear's salary requirement is going to be about twenty times the going 
rate.&nbsp; Furthermore, she will require a signing bonus of around $10 
million.&nbsp; Obviously this compensation package might be a <EM>little</EM> 
more than&nbsp;Microsoft has budgeted.&nbsp; However, SourceGear feels that her 
qualifications and background are easily commensurate with the proposed level of 
pay.&nbsp; In addition, she also has a whole bunch of source code which might be 
useful for this job, and she is willing to bring it all with her as part of the 
deal.</P>
<P>Relocation to Redmond will not be a problem.&nbsp; The free soda sounds 
fine.&nbsp; The foosball table will be really cool, especially since SourceGear 
would be one of the few Microsoft employees who can play both sides at the same 
time.</P>
<P>Even the office sounds like a good fit.&nbsp; Korby&nbsp;described it 
as&nbsp;a "big empty office with all the amenities".&nbsp; That's good, because 
SourceGear really likes an office with plenty of space and quite a few extra 
chairs.</P>
