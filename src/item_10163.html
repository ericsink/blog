<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214327X/sawdust08-20">Coder to 
Developer</a>, by Mike Gunderloy.&nbsp; Very good book.</p>
<p>Mike covers an assortment of topics, all of which are important to software 
development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing features
</li>
<li>Architecture
</li>
<li>Using source control
</li>
<li>Using exceptions and assertions
</li>
<li>Using an IDE
</li>
<li>Examining source code
</li>
<li>Code generation tools
</li>
<li>Bug-tracking
</li>
<li>Logging
</li>
<li>Working on small teams
</li>
<li>Documentation
</li>
<li>Builds
</li>
<li>Licensing
</li>
<li>Installers
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the stuff which is typically not taught.&nbsp; This is the stuff 
which people fresh out of college don't know, and everybody expects them to just 
learn it as they go.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;stuff which distinguishes true <a href="No_Programmers.html">developers</a> from mere 
programmers.</p>
<p>This book mentions a lot of specific technologies and tools, and it's very 
current right now.&nbsp; However, I plan to be fussing at Mike every&nbsp;two 
years for an updated edition.&nbsp; Ten years from now, these important topics 
will still be the difference between coders and developers.</p>
<p>Gunderloy is a fine writer, and the book is enjoyable to read.&nbsp; There's 
an excellent&nbsp;foreword from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel 
Spolsky</a> as well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214327X/sawdust08-20">Coder to 
Developer</a> for all programmers, especially those working in a small ISV.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure:&nbsp; Mike Gunderloy is a fan of SourceGear Vault, and this 
is evident in the book.&nbsp; The truth is that I would recommend this book even 
if all mention of SourceGear were removed.&nbsp; However, I think it is 
appropriate to disclose the facts.</em></p>
