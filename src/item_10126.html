<P>A bit begrudgingly, I am&nbsp;ready to admit that I like Outlook 2003.</P>
<P>When it comes to email clients, I am&nbsp;probably one of the fussiest people 
in the world.&nbsp; I've used lots of different email apps and most of them are 
just lame.&nbsp; I've been crabby about this topic for so long it seems like the 
last decent email client I used was Eudora 3.0.</P>
<P>If I were to rank the worst email clients I have ever tried, the various 
versions of Outlook would hold the top few spots on the list.&nbsp; Outlook 2000 
was particularly awful.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But I recently switched to Outlook 2003, and strangely enough, I actually 
like it.&nbsp; Here's why:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;feel absurdly slow like its ancestors.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It doesn't treat me like a villain for the fact that we don't use 
  Exchange.&nbsp; We've had our mail server running under Linux for ages, and 
  we've never found a compelling reason to change.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It doesn't treat me like a luddite for the fact that I don't like HTML 
  mail.&nbsp; This is the first version of Outlook which works well with 
  good-old-fashioned plain text email.&nbsp; I had&nbsp;to fiddle with the 
  options quite a bit, but the result works perfectly.&nbsp; All my incoming 
  mails are converted to plaintext.&nbsp; All my sent emails are in plaintext, 
  even if I am responding to a message in some other weirdo format.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It still lets me see HTML mail when I want to.&nbsp; Even though I have 
  all my incoming mails converted to plaintext, I can click a button in the 
  message window to show that message as HTML.&nbsp; It doesn't change my global 
  setting for other messages.&nbsp; It simply allows me to see the underlying 
  HTML.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It doesn't load inline images in HTML unless I specifically say so.&nbsp; 
  No more unwanted pictures in my face.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It has taught me that I'm not quite as good of a speller as I thought I 
  was.&nbsp; Believe it or not, I have never used a mail client with built-in 
  spell checking.&nbsp; I'm a pretty decent speller, so it hasn't been much of 
  an issue.&nbsp; But since I switched to Outlook 2003, I've been amazed at the 
  number of typos and spelling errors caught by the spell checker.&nbsp; My 
  apologies to all those people over the years who have endured as I misspelled 
  the word "<EM>committment</EM>".<BR><BR>
  <LI>It has cool flags for followup.&nbsp; I like to click the flag column to 
  mark messages which need my attention.&nbsp; Outlook 2003 keeps a special 
  folder which aggregates all my flagged items together in one view, regardless 
  of where they are located elsewhere in the folder hierarchy.&nbsp; 
  Neato.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It&nbsp;groups items in folders by day, with tree control behavior, 
  allowing me to expand and collapse a whole day's messages at one time.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NewsGator.&nbsp; I like SharpReader, but I'm now giving <A 
  href="http://www.newsgator.com/">NewsGator</A> a try.&nbsp; So far I am very 
  impressed.&nbsp; It's cool having my subscribed feeds show up right there in 
  my mail reader.</LI></UL>
