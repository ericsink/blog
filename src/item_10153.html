<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Vault:  Looking for true love  on Valentine's Day</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">14 Feb 2004</span></p>
<P>On the website of many small ISVs there is a testimonials page which contains 
quotes from happy users of their products.&nbsp; The concept here is 
great:&nbsp; Prospective&nbsp;users <EM>like</EM> knowing how current users 
feel.</P>
<P>However, the usual implementation of this concept has a bug:&nbsp; Since the 
company's website is maintained by the company, it is almost impossible not to 
wonder how those testimonials might have been embellished as they found their 
way onto the site.&nbsp; When I see one of those pages, I always wonder how 
credible it is.&nbsp; Is this true love?&nbsp; Are these real quotes from real 
users who really love this product?</P>
<P>I have always wanted a testimonial page for Vault, but I want one which does 
not have this particular bug.&nbsp; So, I have decided to try something 
different.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Over on SourceGear's forum site, I have created a&nbsp;<A 
href="http://support.sourcegear.com/viewtopic.php?t=166">page</A> which is 
intended to serve as a place to collect&nbsp;positive&nbsp;comments&nbsp;from 
Vault users.&nbsp; The concept here is a testimonial page which is controlled by 
users.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to contribute a few words of praise for Vault can 
simply post their comments as a reply.&nbsp; (There are a few simple ground 
rules which are explained at the top of that page.)</P>
<P>So today I am asking my readers for a favor.&nbsp; If you are a Vault user, 
and if you truly love Vault, please consider expressing your affection by 
posting a few words.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Happy Valentine's Day!</P>
