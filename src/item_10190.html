<P>(To those of you who submitted an incomplete entry, we are sorry, but for 
reasons of fairness to the other participants, we were not able to include your 
work in our contest.)</P>
<P>I gathered all of the entries together and gave them to a&nbsp;panel of other 
SourceGear employees for judging.&nbsp; There were several really excellent 
entries, so the panel&nbsp;had a lot of trouble choosing between them.&nbsp; 
However, in the end, the winner of the contest is...</P>

be unveiled to the world when Dragnet becomes available for public beta 
testing.</P>
<P dir=ltr>To everyone who participated, <STRONG>thank you so 
much</STRONG>.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"> It is unfortunate that we could select only one
