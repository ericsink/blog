<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Good luck collecting the fine</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">08 May 2003</span></p>
<P><A href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30620.html">The 
Register</A>:&nbsp; "the FTC is looking into the Passport breach and could slap 
Microsoft with a fine of $2.2 trillion"</P>
<P>Hmmm.&nbsp; I think I'm going to choose to believe that the author of this 
article doesn't <EM>know</EM> that $2.2 trillion is 7 times more than Microsoft 
is worth.&nbsp; I wonder if we should tell them?</P>
