<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/10/29/1321249">NewsForge</a>:  "SourceForge.net director says Geocrawler and SourceForge.net are healthy."  It might have been more accurate to say that the company is "committed" to SourceForge.net.  It is certainly an overstatement to imply that the company's financial condition is "healthy".  I really hope VA stays alive, but their financials are utterly gruesome.  If my project were hosted at SourceForge, I would be concerned.<br><br>But not alarmed.  I predict that VA will get acquired by IBM, who will keep SourceForge.net operational for as long as they believe Open Source to be their only hope against Microsoft.  <tt>:-)</tt>
