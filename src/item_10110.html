<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Google can be *so* unfair</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">19 Jul 2003</span></p>
<P>The concept of product positioning was invented by <A 
href="http://www.ries.com/">Al Ries</A> and <A 
href="http://troutandpartners.com/">Jack Trout</A> in 1972 when they published a 
series of articles in Advertising Age magazine.&nbsp; Both these guys went on to 
become recognized around the world as gurus in the world of marketing.&nbsp; 
They publish books, advise big&nbsp;companies, and get paid big bucks to speak 
at all kinds of events.</P>
<P>And yet, today&nbsp;when I search Google for the terms "<A 
href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=product+positioning">product 
positioning</A>", the number one result is my <A 
href="/Positioning.html">article</A> on the 
subject.&nbsp; Perhaps more shocking, that first page of results contains 
neither the word "Ries" nor the word "Trout".</P>
<P>That seems ridiculously unfair.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"></P>
<P>I've never written a book.&nbsp; I have a computer science degree, and no 
formal training in marketing.&nbsp; I've never even met Ries or Trout.&nbsp; I 
was four years old when those guys published the definitive articles on 
positioning.&nbsp; And yet, Google is giving innocent people the impression that 
I am&nbsp;the&nbsp;world's expert on the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the way, this&nbsp;is a fun example of how disruptive technologies can 
change the rules <EM>without</EM> creating or destroying business 
opportunities.&nbsp; Not that long ago, a person interested in product 
positioning would probably visit a library.&nbsp; The library staff&nbsp;would 
refer them to the classic&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071373586/sawdust08-20">book</A> 
by Ries and Trout.&nbsp; There was a zero percent chance that the librarian 
would mention my name.&nbsp; But today many people use Google&nbsp;as a 
supplement or replacement for a librarian.&nbsp; My web server logfiles 
currently show that a bunch of people are coming here to my site because they 
searched Google for information about product positioning.&nbsp; In a small way, 
the rules have changed.</P>
<P>During the dot-com craze, we all assumed that every little paradigm shift 
would result in an explosive opportunity for new startups.&nbsp; Billions were 
invested and lost.&nbsp; Hindsight revealed that our assumptions were <A 
href="http://news.com.com/2009-1017-269629.html?legacy=cnet">just</A> <A 
href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3490572.htm">not</A> <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LNUX&amp;d=c&amp;t=5y&amp;l=on&amp;z=b&amp;q=l">true</A>.&nbsp; 
Rule changes do not automatically lead to revenue.&nbsp; Ries and Trout will 
continue to make money for their expertise and reputation.&nbsp; My Google 
ranking is not going to suddenly allow me to displace these guys as a preferred 
consultant or speaker.&nbsp; A paradigm shift and four bucks will get you lunch 
at Taco Bell.</P>
<P>I admit that paradigm shifts <EM>do</EM> create business opportunities for 
those who are sufficiently patient and discerning.&nbsp; But we're all a bit 
more cautious now, because we've learned that great new companies need a lot of 
other ingredients.</P>
