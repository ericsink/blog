<P>We've got a Vault server here at SourceGear which we have setup so we can 
host projects for people in the community.&nbsp; We call it VaultPub.&nbsp; 
Right now there are only a couple of teams hosted there.&nbsp; We'd like a few 
more.</P>
<P>If you have a community project and would be interested in moving your source 
control to VaultPub, first review the <A 
href="http://vaultpub.sourcegear.com/">terms of use</A>.&nbsp; Among those 
terms, I'd like to highlight the two most important ones here:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>When you use VaultPub, you are a beta tester of Vault.&nbsp; The VaultPub 
  server is currently running a pre-release version of Vault 2.0.<BR><BR>
  <LI>VaultPub cannot be used for private projects.&nbsp; Anything you put on 
  VaultPub will be visible to the entire world.</LI></UL>
<P>In addition to the terms of use, please note that VaultPub is not a full 
substitute for something like SourceForge or GotDotNet Workspaces.&nbsp; 
VaultPub currently has source control only.&nbsp; There is no facility for 
bug-tracking or forums or mailing lists or anything like that.&nbsp; Yet.</P>
<P>If you are <EM>still</EM> interested, you can apply by simply sending me an 
<A href="mailto:eric@sourcegear.com">email</A>.&nbsp; Please note also that 
we&nbsp;will probably not&nbsp;be able to accept&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;that 
applies.</P>
