<P>Joel's <A 
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/PickingShipDate.html">latest 
piece</A> is another good one, on the topic of how to choose a ship date: "For 
Systems With Millions of Customers and Millions of Integration Points, Prefer 
Rare Releases. You can do it like Apache: one release at the beginning of the 
Internet Bubble, and one release at the end. Perfect." </P>
<P>My favorite tidbit from the Tech-Ed show this week: I was talking with a 
Microsoftie on Tuesday and I noticed he was wearing one of those bracelets. Many 
Christians wear one that says "WWJD", which stands for "What Would Jesus Do?". 
It took a moment or two of glancing to realize that this guy's bracelet actually 
says "WWBD".<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
