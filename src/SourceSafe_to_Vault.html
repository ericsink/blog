title: Reasons to switch from SourceSafe to Vault
date: 2003-07-14 13:47:03
keywords: sourcegear
teaser: A friend complimented me for not doing any "blatant merchandising" here on my weblog. My reaction was one of surprise. Have I really been forgetting to do blatant merchandising on my weblog? :-) Seriously folks, this article will be the exception, not the rule. Skip this one if you're not interested in windows version control tools. But people frequently ask me why they should consider switching from SourceSafe to Vault, and I would like to answer that question here.

<P>A&nbsp;friend complimented me for not doing any "blatant merchandising" here 
on my weblog.&nbsp; My reaction was one of surprise.&nbsp; Have I really been 
forgetting to do blatant merchandising on my weblog?&nbsp; :-) </P>
<P>Seriously folks, this article will be the exception, not the rule.&nbsp; Skip 
this one if you're not interested in windows version control tools.&nbsp; But 
people frequently ask me why they should consider switching from SourceSafe to 
Vault, and&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;answer that question here.</P>
<P>Reliability</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>SourceSafe has developed a <A 
  href="http://www.michaelbolton.net/testing/VSSDefects.html">reputation</A> as 
  an <A 
  href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/windev/sourcesafe.html">unreliable</A> 
  product, often being referred to by derogatory nicknames like "SortaSafe" and 
  "SourceUnSafe".&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Actually it's not really that bad, but for 
  many developers, data corruption by a source control tool is unforgivable.</P>
  <P>Vault was designed from the beginning with reliability as the number one 
  priority.&nbsp; All repository data is stored in Microsoft SQL Server 2000, 
  providing the Vault server with a robust and trusted data store.&nbsp; We also 
  have an extensive and highly abusive test suite which verifies that the 
  integrity of the repository is preserved, even under pathological 
  conditions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Remote access</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>SourceSafe just does not&nbsp;work well over the Internet.&nbsp; Its design 
  is not based on a client-server approach, so it can be extremely slow when 
  used over network lines with high latency&nbsp;or&nbsp;low bandwidth.&nbsp; 
  Our own <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite</A> 
  product&nbsp;has become&nbsp;very popular&nbsp;as an add-on which solves this 
  problem.&nbsp; <FONT size=2>(BTW, a note to users of SourceOffSite:&nbsp; We 
  recognize that many people will remain with SourceSafe.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are not 
  abandoning SourceOffSite.&nbsp; In fact, we released version 4.0 in March 
  2004.)</FONT></P>
  <P>Vault was designed for the Internet from day one.&nbsp; It was built 
  entirely in C# using the .NET Framework.&nbsp; The Vault server is a 
  collection of XML Web Services running under IIS.&nbsp; The communication 
  between client and server is HTTP, optionally with SSL for security.</P>
  <P>Furthermore, Vault's client-server protocol was designed for the 
  constraints of the Internet.&nbsp; Instead of sending the full contents of a 
  file, Vault can usually save bandwidth by sending only the bytes which have 
  changed.&nbsp; This exchange of "deltas" is used in both directions, from 
  server to client as well as from client to server.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Painless transition</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>As far as we know, Vault is the only version control system designed 
  specifically to replace SourceSafe.&nbsp; In every way possible, Vault 
  presents a familiar interface with familiar terminology.&nbsp; Every major 
  SourceSafe feature is supported, including things like Share and Pin.&nbsp; 
  Our import tool will move your SourceSafe database into a Vault repository, 
  including all historical information.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Visual Studio .NET integration</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Just like SourceSafe, Vault can be used within Visual Studio .NET.&nbsp; 
  This functionality is currently limited because Visual Studio's support for 
  integrated version control is rather poor.&nbsp; As a member of Microsoft's 
  Visual Studio Integration Program (VSIP), SourceGear will be one of the first 
  to provide improved integration when new capabilities become available from 
  Microsoft.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Folder-level Share and Pin</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Vault&nbsp;offers some subtle yet powerful&nbsp;improvements to the Share 
  command.&nbsp; Just as with SourceSafe, a shared item is a single item which 
  appears in multiple places. But SourceSafe can only share files, not 
  folders.</P>
  <P>When you share a folder in SourceSafe, what really happens is that every 
  file underneath that folder is shared, recursively. On a file-by-file basis, 
  the effect is the same. But if you add a file to the shared folder, it does 
  not appear on the other side of the share. The files themselves are shared, 
  but the system has actually made distinct copies of the folder in which they 
  reside.</P>
  <P>In Vault, this share operation is implemented at the level of the folder 
  itself. Just like a shared file, there is really just one instance of a shared 
  folder even though it appears in multiple places. If you add a file to a 
  shared folder, the new file will appear everywhere that folder has been 
  shared. The same applies if you add a subfolder, rename something or delete 
  something. Regardless of what happens to that shared folder, it will be 
  exactly the same in each place that it appears.</P>
  <P>This makes it much more useful to share entire libraries or modules between 
  teams. For example, suppose your project decides they want to make use of a 
  class library being developed by another team. You can share the folder 
  containing their entire code tree into your own tree. Using SourceSafe, when 
  the other team adds a file to their library, your build breaks. Using Vault, 
  any change they make will show up in your tree as well.</P>
  <P>Pin works at the folder level as well. Suppose you have shared another 
  team's library into your tree but that team has since gone astray and begun 
  destabilizing their code. You can pin your shared instance of their folder to 
  the last revision that was stable.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>Atomic checkin transactions</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>When you checkin a set of changes to the Vault server, the 
  operation is performed as a single atomic transaction.&nbsp; If one item fails 
  for any reason, then the entire transaction will fail, and the repository will 
  be left in the condition it was in before the transaction was attempted.&nbsp; 
  This important feature, unsupported by&nbsp;SourceSafe,&nbsp;prevents a 
  half-failed checkin from corrupting the contents of the 
repository.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>CVS mode</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>There are two primary patterns for working with a version control 
  tool.&nbsp; One way is to checkout each file before editing, often with an 
  exclusive lock that prevents others from editing the file.&nbsp; When you're 
  done with the file, you check it back in, releasing it for use by 
  others.&nbsp; We call this the "checkout-edit-checkin" style of 
  development.&nbsp; Most SourceSafe users work this way.</P>
  <P>Another approach is often called the "edit-merge-commit" style of 
  development.&nbsp; In this style, files in your working folders are usually 
  left in a writable state when you retrieve them.&nbsp; When you want to edit a 
  file, you simply do so.&nbsp; The version control tool will automatically 
  notice that you have made changes.&nbsp; Your changes are submitted to the 
  repository when you "commit" them.&nbsp; However, you may not commit your 
  changes if&nbsp;anyone else has modified this&nbsp;file since the last time 
  you retrieved a baseline from the repository.&nbsp; In this case, you must 
  retrieve the latest changes and merge them into your working copy of the 
  file.&nbsp; After doing so, you may proceed to commit your edited version of 
  the file.&nbsp; The source control tool facilitates this process by helping 
  keep track of the versions and making the merge simple.</P>
  <P>Users tend to have extremely strong and divergent opinions about which 
  style is better.&nbsp; Many users do not trust the "edit-merge-commit", 
  preferring the safety of knowing that a given file may never be modified by 
  more than one person at a time.&nbsp; In contrast, those who have used the 
  "edit-merge-commit" cannot imagine returning to the more tedious 
  "checkout-edit-checkin" approach.</P>
  <P>Vault was designed to allow each user to make this choice 
  individually.&nbsp; The default behavior is "checkout-edit-checkin", which 
  will be most familiar to SourceSafe users.&nbsp; But those who prefer 
  "edit-merge-commit" are free to configure their client accordingly.&nbsp; We 
  informally refer to this configuration as "CVS mode", since the 
  "edit-merge-commit" style of concurrent development was made popular by 
  CVS.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>Merging Features</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>The merge features in Vault 2.0 are much improved from Vault 1.x and 
  significantly more powerful than SourceSafe.</P>
  <P>For file-level merging, we provide SourceGear DiffMerge, a standalone tool 
  which supports diff and 3-way merge with a graphical display.&nbsp; For those 
  who prefer to use other diff or merge tools, Vault allows the user to 
  configure an external application.</P>
  <P>The Merge Branches Wizard makes it easy to migrate changes between folders 
  in the repository.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>Blame</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>New in 2.0:&nbsp; Displays an annotated view of a file, showing which user 
  last modified each line.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>Web Client</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>New in 2.0:&nbsp; Allows basic browsing of the contents of a repository 
  using any web browser.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Vault Client API</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>A source control system is not just a tool, it is also a platform.&nbsp; 
  Many users need the ability to build custom solutions which interact with 
  their source control repositories,&nbsp;for things like reporting 
  and&nbsp;automated builds.</P>
  <P>SourceSafe frustrates in this regard, offering a subset&nbsp;API which is 
  incomplete and sometimes unreliable.</P>
  <P>SourceGear&nbsp;provides the Vault Client API, which allows our customers 
  to build custom clients using the same API we use.&nbsp; We cannot yet promise 
  that the API is frozen.&nbsp; We can't brag about the completeness of the 
  documentation yet.&nbsp; But we do provide the source code for our 
  command-line client as sample code.&nbsp; And we try to answer every question 
  about this API on our public mailing list.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>History Explorer</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Building Vault on SQL Server brings other advantages besides 
  reliability.&nbsp; Using the query capabilities of SQL, Vault's History 
  Explorer offers powerful new ways to view what the changes that have happened 
  in your repository.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Obliterate</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>An important pillar in the philosophy of source control is that the 
  repository should include every change which has ever happened.&nbsp; 
  Destroying data permanently is equivalent to rewriting history, and should be 
  strongly discouraged.</P>
  <P>SourceSafe makes this sin far too tempting by providing a "Destroy 
  permanently" checkbox in the dialog used for deleting a file.</P>
  <P>Vault's design is safer.&nbsp; Anything which permanently destroys 
  historical information is called "Obliterate".&nbsp; These features can only 
  be performed from the Admin Client, not from within the regular user 
  client.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Integrated bug tracking</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Source control and bug-tracking go hand-in-hand, but SourceSafe is 
  ignorant.&nbsp; Vault currently offers integration with <A 
  href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">FogBUGZ</A>.&nbsp; In conjunection 
  with Vault 2.1, we will provide a .NET port of our own bug-tracking system, 
  supporting full integration with Vault.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Honesty and Openness</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>We try to be forthcoming about the areas where our product needs to 
  improve, to ensure that expectations are appropriately set.&nbsp; We would 
  rather lose a sale than obtain a disappointed customer.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>Over and over, our customers tell us how much they appreciate this posture 
  of honesty.&nbsp; From our point of view, nothing else would make sense.&nbsp; 
  We know our customers are smart people who develop software just like we do, 
  so we give them the facts.&nbsp; If we can't win your business today, we'll 
  win it tomorrow.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>SourceGear</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>SourceGear is now over seven years old&nbsp; Our list of satisfied 
  customers includes hundreds of names you know, from every industry, from all 
  over the world.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>In October 2002 we were named <A 
  href="http://www.inc.com/apps/inc500/viewCompany.jsp?cmpId=2002156">#156</A> 
  on the Inc 500, Inc magazine's list of the fastest growing private companies 
  in America.&nbsp; Microsoft itself was once a winner of this same award.</P>
  <P>SourceGear&nbsp;is definitely&nbsp;still a small company.&nbsp; Many of our 
  customers are several orders of magnitude larger than we are.&nbsp; But 
  companies large and small continue to buy from us with confidence.&nbsp; We 
  are profitable and conservatively-managed, and we plan to be around for a very 
  long time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
