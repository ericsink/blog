<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #18:  The Law of Success</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">24 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Success says that "success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance 
to failure".</P>
<P>The basic point of this chapter is a warning to not let yourself get too far 
from your customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly small ISVs may not need to worry too much 
about this, but the admonition is valuable nonetheless.</P>
<P>As companies grow, the CEO tends to get busy with other stuff.&nbsp; She 
doesn't spend much time "in the trenches" anymore.&nbsp; He goes to a lot of 
meetings and spends a lot of time working on the big picture.&nbsp; In the 
process, she loses touch with the customer.</P>
<P>Despite what the chapter says, I think this effect may or may not be rooted 
in arrogance.&nbsp; The root problem might be simpler and more innocent.&nbsp; 
Maybe the CEO simply let himself get too busy.&nbsp; It seems quite possible to 
become detached from the basic activities of the company without growing a big 
ego.</P>
<P>But either way, forgetting the customer is a fatal disease.&nbsp; 
Fortunately,&nbsp;this disease&nbsp;is also preventable and treatable.&nbsp; 
Don't let it happen to you.&nbsp; Even as your company grows, stay involved in 
the basic stuff, at least a little bit:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>When you go to a trade show, spend some time in the booth talking to 
  prospective customers. 
  <LI>Answer a tech support call. 
  <LI>Write some code. 
  <LI>Help with the testing before the next release.</LI></UL>
<P>Don't get out of touch.&nbsp; When you do, you'll start to make bad marketing 
decisions.</P>
