<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #21:  The Law of Acceleration</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">29 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Acceleration says that "successful programs are not built on fads, 
they're built on trends".</P>
<P>Drawing their examples from mainstream consumer products, the authors observe 
the tendency for companies to overestimate short-term fads.&nbsp; When something 
new becomes big and hot, companies jump on the bandwagon, spending a lot of 
money doing so.&nbsp; They restructure.&nbsp; They invest in new 
equipment.&nbsp; They work hard to make themselves prepared to deliver products 
for the fad.</P>
<P>And then the fad stops, and the company is left with problems:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>"What am I going to do with all the olive green refrigerators 
  and&nbsp;orange carpeting I bought just before the fashion changed?"<BR><BR> 
  <LI>"Oh, great -- I can produce fifty gazillion Cabbage Patch dolls per 
  day.&nbsp; That'll come in handy now that nobody wants them anymore." <BR><BR>
  <LI>"Darn it!&nbsp; I just bought a warehouse of fruit-colored translucent 
  plastic, and now I find that the <EM>next</EM> iMac looks like a white desk 
  lamp."</LI></UL>
<P>Fads accelerate very quickly, but often don't last long.&nbsp; Trends have a 
much slower acceleration, but eventually run fast and steady.&nbsp; Chasing fads 
is expensive, so it becomes very important to learn how to distinguish them from 
actual long-term trends.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This discernment is particularly important for small ISVs.&nbsp; We are 
constantly being presented with new technologies, new protocols, new formats, 
new platforms, new components, and new APIs.&nbsp; Which ones will 
be&nbsp;strong in five years?&nbsp; We want to know if we will eventually regret 
building our apps on a given piece of technology.</P>
<P>I'm not sure&nbsp;this issue has ever produced questions&nbsp;more difficult 
than the ones we are facing today, such as:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Web applications</STRONG>:&nbsp; Is this a real long-term 
  trend?&nbsp; Will it <EM>ever</EM> be possible to create rich apps with 
  HTML?&nbsp; Will Microsoft succeed in&nbsp;using its control of the desktop to 
  kill this trend?<BR><BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Web Services</STRONG>:&nbsp; Is this fad going to become a trend 
  or not?&nbsp; We loved Web Services because they were simple, but they're 
  getting <A 
  href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Jun-27.html">less 
  simple</A> all the time.<BR><BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Windows Forms</STRONG>:&nbsp; Microsoft wanted me to get off MFC 
  and onto Windows Forms.&nbsp; Now they want me to get off Windows Forms and 
  onto Avalon.&nbsp; Doesn't <EM>anybody</EM> have an available API which is not 
  planned for deprecation?</LI></UL>
<P>These may not seem like marketing decisions, but they are.&nbsp; Technology 
choices have big marketing implications.&nbsp; When you choose a platform, you 
define the maximum size of your market.</P>
<P>I can't answer the questions above, but I will repeat one thing I've said 
before:&nbsp; The technologies from the previous wave still work.&nbsp; If you 
want to be an INETA speaker, yes, you need to be current with the very latest 
stuff.&nbsp; But if you are building products or solutions to be used today, 
there isn't any shame in choosing a platform and toolset which has completely 
proven itself as more than a fad.</P>
