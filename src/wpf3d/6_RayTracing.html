<p>This entry is part 6 of a <a
href="/wpf3d/index.html">12-part series</a> on WPF
3D.</p>

<h3>Not a Ray Tracer</h3>

<p>To understand what something is, sometimes it is helpful to
talk about what it is not.</p>

<p>WPF 3D is not a ray tracer.</p>

<p>The two common ways of rendering 3D objects are:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Describe objects as polygons (broken into triangles).&nbsp; Do
     a projection to 2D and use some clever shortcuts to simulate lighting.&nbsp;
     This is the method used by accelerated graphics APIs, including WPF,
     Direct3D, OpenGL and their ilk.&nbsp; All real-time games use this method or
     something similar to it.</li>
 <li >Describe objects using whatever form makes sense for that
     object.&nbsp; For every pixel in the resulting image, fire one or more light
     rays, tracing the path of light to determine the proper coloring for that
     pixel.&nbsp; An example of a ray tracer is <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a>.&nbsp;
     Some movies use this method, such as <a
     href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268380/">Ice Age</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is generally true that ray tracing produces higher
quality images.&nbsp; So why do we bother with the other method when our
grandfathers told us that anything worth doing is worth doing right?&nbsp; Our
grandfathers were not software developers.&nbsp; Ray tracing is hundreds or
thousands of times slower.&nbsp; Given a choice between a good rendering in 10
milliseconds or a great rendering in 10 seconds, there are times we want to
choose the former.</p>

<p>But what is this difference between good and great?&nbsp; We
always say that ray tracing produces higher quality images, but I've seen some
pretty amazing stuff rendered by OpenGL or Direct3D.&nbsp; Exactly <i>how</i> are
ray-traced images of higher quality?</p>

<h3>Curves</h3>

<p>Remember in <a
href="/wpf3d/5_Triangles.html">part 5</a> when I said that
every polygon can be decomposed into triangles?&nbsp; This is true, but not
everything is a polygon.&nbsp; What if you want to render a sphere?&nbsp; You can only <i>approximate</i>
a sphere with a triangle mesh.</p>

<p>Ray tracing doesn't have this problem.&nbsp; A ray tracer will
usually represent a sphere in a more exact fashion.&nbsp; It knows how to intersect
rays with the equation of a sphere.&nbsp; The quality of the resulting image is
limited only by the resolution of that image.</p>

<h3>Shadows and Reflections</h3>

<p>Accelerated graphics APIs like OpenGL do not automatically
draw shadows or reflections.&nbsp; There just isn't any good way to calculate
shadows when you're trying to render 60 frames per second.&nbsp; Reflections are
even worse.</p>

<p>But both of these things are quite simple for a ray tracer.&nbsp;
Want to find shadows?&nbsp; Fire a ray and find the 3D point where it intersects.&nbsp;
Then fire a ray from that point to the light source.&nbsp; If the second ray doesn't
hit the light source directly, you are in a shadow.</p>

<p>The quintessential demo for a ray tracer is a chrome sphere
casting a shadow on the floor.</p>

<h3>Transparency</h3>

<p>Remember in <a
href="/wpf3d/2_Transparency.html">part 2</a> when I was
fussing about transparency?&nbsp; Accelerated graphics APIs need you to sort things
because they use a shortcut called a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">Z-buffer</a>.&nbsp; Ray tracing can do
transparency more accurately because it's not in such a hurry.&nbsp; A ray tracer
can take the time to intersect every ray with every object in the scene, just
to make sure it doesn't miss anything.</p>

<h3>A Project Idea</h3>

<p>As I write this, I look out the window to my left and see
the University of Illinois campus.&nbsp; The fall semester will start in six weeks
or so.&nbsp; I assume that one of this fall's classes will be "Introduction to
Computer Graphics".&nbsp; I further assume that there will be approximately 100
students in that class, and that each of them will be asked to write a ray
tracer.</p>

<p>A little web research suggests that in the United States there are 479 colleges and universities that offer a computer science
program.&nbsp; Extending my assumptions to the national level, I figure all of them
have a computer graphics course with an average of 50 students every semester.&nbsp;
So as a society, each year we are producing over 47,000 new ray tracer
implementations.</p>

<p>And that's just here in the United States.&nbsp; When I think
about all the other CS students worldwide, I shudder to think how many homeless
ray tracers are being born every year.&nbsp; (Please, folks, have your ray tracer
spayed or neutered.)</p>

<p>As long as we're writing so many ray tracers, why not write
one for WPF?</p>

<p>Because WPF 3D is built on a "retained scene" model, a
Viewport3D object has all the information necessary for rendering.&nbsp; We can
write a ray tracer which takes a Viewport3D and returns an image which was
constructed by ray tracing its contents.&nbsp; Basically, it's the same task as
writing any other ray tracer, except instead of creating a new scene
description language, you just use the one provided by WPF.</p>

<p>Remember of course that in WPF, everything is a triangle.&nbsp;
So don't expect photorealistic rendering of a chrome sphere unless your
triangles are really small.</p>

<p>But I still think a WPF ray tracer would actually be
useful.&nbsp; If you already have a Viewport3D anyway, it might be nice to be able
to paste it into a WPF ray tracer and get a rendering which has reflections and
shadows.</p>

<p>I'll get you started.&nbsp; The shell of your ray tracer will
probably look something like this:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";color:blue'>public</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'> <span style='color:teal'>BitmapSource</span>
RayTrace(<span style='color:teal'>Viewport3D</span> vp)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>int</span> width = (<span style='color:blue'>int</span>)vp.Width;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>int</span> height = (<span style='color:blue'>int</span>)vp.Height;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>byte</span>[] pixelData = <span style='color:blue'>new</span>
<span style='color:blue'>byte</span>[width * height * 3];<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>for</span> (<span style='color:blue'>int</span> c
= 0; c &lt; width; c++)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>for</span> (<span style='color:blue'>int</span>
r = 0; r &lt; height; r++)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:teal'>Color</span> clr = GetColorForPixel(vp, c,
r);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pixelData[(r * width + c) * 3 + 0] = clr.R;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pixelData[(r * width + c) * 3 + 1] = clr.G;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pixelData[(r * width + c) * 3 + 2] = clr.B;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:teal'>BitmapSource</span> bmpSource = <span
style='color:teal'>BitmapSource</span>.Create(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width, height, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96, 96,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:teal'>PixelFormats</span>.Rgb24, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>null</span>, pixelData, width * 3);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>return</span> bmpSource;<br>
}</span></p>

<p>Now you basically just need to implement GetColorForPixel().&nbsp;
One of the first lines of that method is probably going to look like this:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";color:teal'>RayMeshGeometry3DHitTestResult</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'> hit =<br>
&nbsp; (<span style='color:teal'>RayMeshGeometry3DHitTestResult</span>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='color:teal'>VisualTreeHelper</span>.HitTest(vp, <span
style='color:blue'>new</span> <span style='color:teal'>Point</span>(c, r));</span></p>

<p>Also, in RayTrace(), before you start the loop, you probably
want to walk through all the children of the Viewport3D and find all the lights.&nbsp;
This will save you the cost of doing that search once for every pixel.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
