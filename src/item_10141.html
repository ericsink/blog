<P>Here in Illinois we have this thing called "<A 
href="http://www.revenue.state.il.us/LegalInformation/regs/part150/">use 
tax</A>".&nbsp; Basically, "use tax" is sales tax paid on things you didn't buy 
in Illinois.&nbsp; Many people mistakenly believe that if you buy&nbsp;an 
item&nbsp;by mail order you can avoid paying your state sales tax.&nbsp; Alas, 
the state of Illinois has plugged this loophole by creating "use 
tax".&nbsp;&nbsp;When we buy something through mail order or over the Internet, 
we're supposed to send them money for the "use" of the item.&nbsp; I've heard 
that some other states do this too.</P>
<P>The Illinois Department of Revenue just <EM>loves</EM>&nbsp;to do&nbsp;Sales 
and Use Tax audits, because lots of companies either don't know about use tax or 
routinely forget to pay it.&nbsp; They called us today to let us know that it's 
our turn.&nbsp; In a few weeks, a band of bean counters in blue suits&nbsp;is 
going to burst into our offices with Vaseline and flashlights, crawling through 
every dark corner of our company finances for the last seven years, trying to 
find every single time we ordered a book or a pack of Sharpies or a laptop and 
forgot to send them&nbsp;6.25%.</P>
<P>Have you ever seen a tax auditor just before he is leaving to go do an 
audit?&nbsp; He has a sadistic gleam in his eye and his arms&nbsp;are 
covered&nbsp;with goosebumps from the anticipation.&nbsp; A Sales and Use Tax 
audit is an auditor's dream, far better than collecting the use tax in the first 
place, because they can heap on the penalties and interest as well.&nbsp; Aside 
from dentistry, this is one of the few remaining professions for a man who 
derives satisfaction from the suffering of others.&nbsp; These audits can be 
hideous, even for businesses which are careful.&nbsp; I've seen small companies 
get whacked&nbsp;for tens of thousands of dollars.</P>
<P>If I were allowed to give tax advice, I would tell every small ISV owner to 
be careful&nbsp;and to check your state laws and to be sure that you pay your 
use taxes diligently.</P>
<P>But as it turns out, I am <EM>not</EM> allowed to give tax advice, so I won't 
say that.&nbsp; Instead, I'll just do as the drug companies do on their TV 
commercials:</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>"Ask your tax accountant if use tax is right for 
you."</STRONG></P>
