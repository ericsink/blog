<P>This page serves as the table of contents for&nbsp;my series of articles 
entitled "Marketing for Geeks".&nbsp; The central theme here is that if we 
demystify marketing, it can be competently done by technical people.&nbsp; The 
series is still being written, with new articles coming soon to an RSS feed near 
you.</P>
<P>In most <A href="Small_ISV_Defined.html">small 
ISVs</A>, it's important for at least some of the&nbsp;developers to have an 
understanding of basic marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most&nbsp;geeks tend to 
shy away from marketing, citing their lack of creativity and graphic design 
skills.&nbsp; But these are typically not the differentiators which determine 
whether marketing is competent or not.&nbsp; Marketing efforts tend to succeed 
or fail on their strategy, not on their artwork.&nbsp; In fact, many teams can 
improve their marketing simply by realizing that marketing, like software 
development, has two distinct phases.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>The Two Phases of 
Marketing</FONT></P>
<P>When we build software, we typically have a design phase, followed by an 
implementation phase.&nbsp; In the design phase, we carefully figure out exactly 
what we want to do.&nbsp; In the implementation phase, we do it.</P>
<P>Likewise, marketing has a strategic phase, followed by a&nbsp;communication 
phase.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The strategic phase is analogous to the design phase of building 
  software.&nbsp; (In fact, they are related and must usually be done 
  together.)<BR><BR>
  <LI>The communication phase is analogous to the implementation phase of 
  building software.&nbsp; We call this set of activities "marketing 
  communications", or "marcomm" for short.</LI></UL>
<P>I find it interesting that although marketing people and technical people 
often think they have nothing in common, both groups naturally try to weasel out 
of doing their first phase.&nbsp; Maverick programmers don't want to write specs 
and do design.&nbsp; They simply want to write code.&nbsp; Similarly, marketing 
people&nbsp;often prefer&nbsp;to plunge headfirst into creating messages, 
taglines and ad campaigns.&nbsp; In either case, skipping the first phase will 
get you the instant gratification of visible results, but you'll&nbsp;have all 
kinds of trouble down the road.</P>

  Your Competition</A> <BR>
  <P>"It's important to specifically choose who you want your competition to 
  be.&nbsp; I like the Jim Barksdale philosophy of choosing competition:&nbsp; 
  Find a competitor who is "big and dumb"."</P>
  <LI><A href="Positioning.html">Marketing is not a 
  Post-Processing Step</A> <BR>
  <P>"Marketing is not just telling the world about your product.&nbsp; 
  Marketing is also deciding what product to build.&nbsp; You have to design and 
  build your product to fit the market position you want it to have."</P>
  <LI><A href="Act_Your_Age.html">Act Your Age</A> 
  <BR>
  <P>"But step three is something that happens to your product whether you like 
  it or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not unlike&nbsp;the natural aging process we experience 
  as human beings, our products go through various stages of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
  both cases, the only way to avoid the next stage is death, so we might as well 
  learn to handle these stages with&nbsp;a measure of grace."</P>

  <P><A href="Geek_Gauntlets.html">Geek 
  Gauntlets</A>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>"To reach mainstream customers, we sometimes need to ignore our own 
  preferences and just do what the customers want.&nbsp; Non-geeks in marketing 
  generally have no trouble with this.&nbsp; Once they decide what the market 
  prefers, all they want to do is get that product into the customer's 
  hands.&nbsp; They don't have strong opinions about technology, so they don't 
  have trouble separating customer preferences from their own."</P></LI></UL>

  Advertising Guide for Small ISVs</A> </P>
  <P>"For most small ISVs, print advertising is just not an appropriate use of 
  funds.&nbsp; For example, a full page color ad in a major software development 
  magazine will cost over $10,000.&nbsp; How many copies of your product would 
  you have to sell in order to pay for that ad?&nbsp; Frankly, ten thousand 
  lottery tickets might be a better investment."</P>

  to a Trade Show</A><BR><BR>"Advertising and PR are primarily one-way 
  communication, from you to the customer, without much chance for information 
  to flow the other way. In contrast, a trade show offers face time. The trade 
  show experience provides us a perspective that cannot be obtained in any other 
  way. Other marcomm tools certainly have their place, but there is nothing like 
  a trade show."</P></LI></UL>
