<P>The Law of Perception says that in the battle between products, perception is 
more important than reality.</P>
<P>People tend to think that the best product will win.&nbsp; However, as Ries 
and Trout say, "Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of 
perceptions."&nbsp; Sometimes the best product does not win.</P>
<P>This concept seems unfair, but it's fundamental and we might as well get used 
to it.&nbsp; Ries and Trout go so far as to say that&nbsp;"Most marketing 
mistakes stem from the assumption that you're fighting a product battle rooted 
in reality.&nbsp; All the laws in this book are derived from the exact opposite 
point of view."</P>

<P>The real&nbsp;issue here is that the words "better" and "best" are subjective 
terms.&nbsp; People have different requirements and preferences upon which they 
form very different opinions.&nbsp; There are very few absolutes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>One could credibly argue that OS/2 was "better" than Windows 
3.x.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 68k chip was better in some ways than the x86 line.&nbsp; 
But those are perceptions and opinions.&nbsp; In hindsight, we can simply say 
that <STRONG>more</STRONG> people perceived Windows and the Intel chip to be 
better.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Reality Still Matters</FONT></P>
<P>My only gripe with this chapter is that it sometimes tries to convince me 
that perception and reality are entirely disjoint.&nbsp; They're not.&nbsp; 
Quite frequently, perception is merely an exaggeration of reality.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Here at SourceGear we've got quite a few servers.&nbsp; We have Windows 
servers, and we have Linux servers.&nbsp; Our internal file server is named 
"Mufasa".&nbsp;&nbsp;Every once in a while, Mufasa&nbsp;gags for no apparent 
reason and requires a reboot.&nbsp; I can't remember&nbsp;this ever happening to 
a Linux box here.&nbsp; This experience has caused me (and others) to perceive 
Windows as being less stable than Linux.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean I think it 
is fair to categorically label Windows as an unstable product.&nbsp; After all, 
our phone system is running on Windows and it never has any problems.&nbsp; 
There is reality here, but there is exaggeration here as well.</P>
<P>I think it's important to remember the Law of Perception, but I would worry 
if small ISVs started taking it too seriously.&nbsp; Specifically, let's 
<STRONG>not</STRONG> just give up on our desire to make our products better, 
choosing instead to spend all our resources on the management of customer 
perception.&nbsp; The Law of Perception can help us understand when things don't 
seem to make sense, but it's not so powerful that product excellence doesn't 
matter.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>One Final Thought</FONT></P>
<P>The Law of Perception is just one more reason why small ISVs need to get 
specific as they choose their competition.&nbsp; Don't&nbsp;try to create a 
"better" product.&nbsp; That strategy is too vague.&nbsp; Instead, try to create 
a product which is better for a&nbsp;specific group of people with specific 
problems that are not being solved very well by others.&nbsp; That specific 
group of people will perceive your product as the best.</P>
