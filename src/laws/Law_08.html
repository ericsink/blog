Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of&nbsp;Duality says that "in the long run, every market becomes a 
two-horse race."</P>
<P>Young&nbsp;markets have many rungs on the ladder.&nbsp; They are highly 
fragmented.&nbsp; Gradually, as the market matures, players disappear and the 
market settles on exactly two primary players.&nbsp; Examples of this phenomenon 
are everywhere:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Coke and Pepsi 
  <LI>Canon and Nikon 
  <LI>Nike and Reebok 
  <LI>GM and Ford 
  <LI>McDonalds and Burger King</LI></UL>
<P>It often takes a long time for things to settle down, but in the end, markets 
usually give people what they want, which is <STRONG>two strong 
choices</STRONG>.&nbsp; Buyers don't like&nbsp;choosing between ten or twenty 
players.&nbsp; It's too stressful.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A big reason for this effect is that most people don't make their own buying 
decisions.&nbsp; People tend to buy what <A 
href="http://software.ericsink.com/Act_Your_Age.html">somebody else</A> is 
buying.&nbsp; Pragmatists buy something only after they see the Early Adopters 
buying it.&nbsp; Conservatives buy it only after the Pragmatists are buying 
it.&nbsp; Laggards buy it only when the peer pressure and ridicule is so severe 
that they look like absurd for not buying it.&nbsp; Market share begets market 
share, and the rich get richer.</P>
<P>Even as the market gets very mature, it will continue to tolerate the 
presence of more than two players.&nbsp; However, the top two will have the 
lion's share of the market.&nbsp; All other players are essentially in niche 
segments.</P>
<P>Once a market reaches this state, it will generally not allow #1 and #2 to 
move around.&nbsp; For example, the market will never allow the top two players 
to change positions.&nbsp; Burger King will never be #1.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the market will not allow #1 to get too far ahead.&nbsp; Just as 
markets hate having a ten-horse race, they also hate having a one-horse 
race.&nbsp; When #1 gets too far ahead of #2, the market will usually correct 
the problem.</P>

<P>At this point, I assume most of my readers are confused.&nbsp; After all, 
everything I said above makes virtually no sense at all when we look at the 
software industry.&nbsp; We don't have two strong choices.&nbsp; Most software 
market segments are a one-horse race.&nbsp; In many cases, Microsoft is so 
utterly dominant that there is no clear #2.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>There is no strong #2 desktop operating system. 
  <LI>There is no strong #2 office suite 
  <LI>There is no strong #2 developer IDE.</LI></UL>
<P>Why do these markets&nbsp;not follow the Law of Duality?</P>
<P>The popular notion today is that Microsoft is an illegal monopoly.&nbsp; I 
have generally tried to stay out of this debate and I think I will continue to 
do so.&nbsp; Antitrust law has never made sense to me anyway.</P>
<P>But whether or not Microsoft is a violator of government law, it is clearly a 
violator of the natural laws of marketing.&nbsp; The current situation in 
software is not supposed to be possible.&nbsp; The market should have ensured 
the presence of a strong #2, but it has not.</P>
<P>Even more strange here is the fact that software is still a rather young 
industry.&nbsp; At its tender age of perhaps three decades, we should expect to 
still have very high fragmentation.&nbsp; But we don't.</P>
<P>I don't think antitrust law is the answer.&nbsp; It is quite clear that the 
federal government is no match for Microsoft.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But the market itself still has a lot of power.&nbsp; The Law of Duality may 
yet show up.</P>
