Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Sacrifice says that "you have to give up something in order to get 
something".</P>
<P>The cool thing about this law is that it's not automatically 
attractive.&nbsp; It makes you think.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Law of Focus isn't like that.&nbsp; When people hear about the Law of 
Focus, the first reaction is to say, "Yes, yes, focus is good."&nbsp; People 
seem to forget that the word "focus" implies a decision about what you are 
<STRONG>not</STRONG> going to do.&nbsp; With the word "sacrifice", that 
particular implication is much clearer.</P>
<P>But in some sense, these two laws are the same idea with different 
expressions.&nbsp; There is power in focus, but to get there, we have to make 
tough decisions about what things we will <STRONG>not</STRONG> do.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Aiming once again at Scotts 
Valley</FONT></P>
<P>I'll give Sun a break today and go back to picking on Borland.&nbsp; Here is 
a perfect example of a company that can't focus because they're not willing to 
sacrifice.&nbsp; Their product line is all over the map.</P>
<P>The problem with not having a focus is that your customers can only describe 
you in terms of your past.&nbsp; Borland's "Excellence Endures" tagline even 
reinforces this.&nbsp; It's a fine tagline, but it doesn't say much to me about 
the future.&nbsp; It is a celebration of their 20 years of history.</P>
<P>Borland is a fine company with some great products.&nbsp; But they should be 
telling us more about their future than their past.&nbsp; In the next five 
years, what <STRONG>one</STRONG> thing will Borland do better than anybody 
else?</P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT size=2>(To be fair, however, we 
should admit that Borland's marketing may not matter much.&nbsp; Microsoft needs 
Borland (and Apple, and Sun) to exist in order to give the illusion that their 
products have competition.&nbsp; In this case, Excellence will continue to 
Endure, but Mediocrity would suffice, since Microsoft will always stop a little 
bit short of killing them off.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Saying "No"</FONT></P>
<P>The Law of Sacrifice is all about saying "no" to opportunities.&nbsp; This 
skill is incredibly difficult to learn.&nbsp; I suspect that the only way to 
learn to say "no" is to experience the pain of saying "yes" too often.</P>
<P>That's how I learned it.&nbsp; SourceGear used to be all over the map.&nbsp; 
We smiled and described that condition with a positive spin, telling ourselves 
that we were "opportunistic".&nbsp; But life inside the company got pretty 
confusing.&nbsp; We had several product efforts going on, all unrelated.&nbsp; 
We had a consulting division doing engagements which were not related to any of 
our products.&nbsp; When someone asked us "<EM>What does SourceGear do?</EM>" it 
would take ten minutes to explain.&nbsp; By the time we were done, the elevator 
had gone back and forth to the lobby&nbsp;three times.</P>
<P>Our revenue was high, but we had no focus.&nbsp; We were in a strategy which 
was positive in the short-term and <A 
href="http://software.ericsink.com/item_10186.html">negative</A> in the 
long-term.&nbsp; So we sacrificed.&nbsp; We started saying "no".</P>
<P>At first, it was really hard.&nbsp; People called us for a consulting gig and 
we turned it down.&nbsp; Even as I write this, it sounds crazy.&nbsp; I said 
"no" to <STRONG>money</STRONG>!&nbsp; What was I thinking?</P>
<P>It took a while, but things got better.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot better.&nbsp; Today, 
SourceGear is a focused company, but to get to this point, we had to stop saying 
"yes" to every opportunity we saw.</P>
