Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>This is one of my favorite chapters.&nbsp; The Law of Focus says that "the 
most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's 
mind."&nbsp;&nbsp;This law challenges us to&nbsp;boil&nbsp;our marketing message 
down to&nbsp;just one&nbsp;idea.&nbsp; If you can teach your market segment to 
associate your product with a single idea, perhaps even a single word, you can 
be a market leader.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Count Your Words</FONT></P>
<P>When entrepreneurs ask me for advice, I&nbsp;usually ask them to&nbsp;explain 
their product in 25 words or less.&nbsp; Hardly anybody can do it.&nbsp; The 
software developer&nbsp;is in love with&nbsp;his product and is unaware of the 
fact that nobody else is.&nbsp; Ask&nbsp;him to talk&nbsp;about his product and 
he will&nbsp;give you twenty minutes&nbsp;of rambling love poetry starting with 
a feature set and ending with a description of some arcane aspect of the 
product's underlying architecture.&nbsp; The customer has lost interest after 
the first ten seconds.&nbsp; The&nbsp;wire between your marketing efforts and 
your customer's mind is an extremely low bandwidth connection.&nbsp; Less is 
more.</P>
<P>During the dotcom bubble,&nbsp;as we all wasted three years of our lives 
chasing venture capitalists around like groupies, they taught us one useful 
concept:&nbsp; The elevator pitch.&nbsp; This is a major step in the right 
direction.&nbsp; The idea is that you have to explain your product and its 
benefits in the amount of time&nbsp;you spend in&nbsp;an elevator.&nbsp; In 
other words, you've got well under a minute.&nbsp; No time for product love 
poetry.</P>
<P>But the Law of Focus would claim that an elevator ride is&nbsp;far too 
long.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Law of Focus&nbsp;would insist&nbsp;that a 25 word description is about 
24 words too many.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Law of Focus demands that we explain our product in one word.&nbsp; Ries 
and Trout say, "No matter how complicated the product, no matter how complicated 
the needs of the market, it's always better to focus on one word or benefit than 
two or three or four."</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Examples</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI>What shipping company comes to mind when you hear the word 
  "overnight"?&nbsp; (Federal Express) 
  <LI>Which ketchup comes to mind when you hear the word "slow"?&nbsp; (Heinz) 
  <LI>What insurance company comes to mind when you hear the word "hands"?&nbsp; 
  (AllState)</LI></UL>
<P>Each of these companies has used a single idea or word as the basis for its 
primary message.</P>
<P>For another example, take a look at two of the major wireless phone providers 
in the United States&nbsp;today.&nbsp; Each of them has carefully chosen just 
one concept as their message:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>For Sprint, the concept is Clarity.&nbsp; Ten times a week we hear their 
  spokesman clearing up some goofy misunderstanding caused by the unclear calls 
  of one of their competitors. 
  <LI>For Verizon Wireless, the concept is is Coverage.&nbsp; Twenty times a 
  week we hear their spokesman saying, "Can you hear me&nbsp;now?&nbsp; Good!" 
  </LI></UL>
<P>These two companies each have plenty of other benefits they could be talking 
about.&nbsp; They could tell us about their great selection of phones.&nbsp; 
They could brag about their pricing.&nbsp; They could talk about safety 
issues.&nbsp; Instead, they have each focused their marketing message around 
just one idea.</P>
<P>As the chapter says, "The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus.&nbsp; 
You become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations."</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Crafting Your Message</FONT></P>
<P>It's okay to have more information handy.&nbsp; Datasheets and whitepapers 
are great.&nbsp; Once people get interested, they will probably want all the 
detail you can provide.&nbsp; But for first impressions, you should tell the 
world only one thing about your product.&nbsp; You can use 2-3 words as long as 
you are not trying to sneak in extra ideas.&nbsp; Usually, you need only one 
word.&nbsp; But which word to pick?</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Pick a reasonably common word out of the dictionary.&nbsp; It should be a 
  word that everybody understands.&nbsp; Don't invent a new word that nobody has 
  ever heard. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Don't try to associate your product with a word in the customer's mind if 
  that word is already associated with your competitor. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Don't pick the word "cheap" or any of its synonyms.&nbsp; Very few 
  businesses can thrive while making low price their primary message.&nbsp; 
  Wal-Mart is one of those businesses.&nbsp; Your small ISV is not. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Don't pick the word "quality" unless you can prove that you care about 
  quality a lot more than everybody else.&nbsp; As Ries and Trout say, 
  "everybody stands for quality.&nbsp; As a result, nobody does."</LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Sheepish Confession</FONT></P>
<P>Among the many violators of Law #5 is SourceGear itself.&nbsp; Shameful as it 
seems, we built the marketing message for Vault around three ideas, not one:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Reliability 
  <LI>Internet-readiness 
  <LI>Seamless transition from SourceSafe</LI></UL>
<P>We've been very consistent about using the same three&nbsp;talking 
points&nbsp;in all of our advertising materials and presentations.&nbsp; We 
sometimes vary the way we explain them, but we always work with these same three 
points.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This campaign has worked out very well for us, but Law #5 says&nbsp;we would 
be&nbsp;even more effective if we replaced our three-point message with a 
one-point message.&nbsp; In the future, we will probably move in that 
direction.</P>
