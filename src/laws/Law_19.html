<p><em>(This entry is part of a <a href="/laws/Immutable_Laws_Marketing.html">series</a> I am writing on 
</em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><em>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</em></a><em>.)</em></p>
<p>The Law of Failure says that "failure is to be expected and accepted".</p>
<p>Nothing interesting ever happens unless we take risks.&nbsp; The authors 
encourage an atmosphere of risk-taking with a good discussion of why individuals 
tend to be afraid of taking risks.</p>
<p>The chapter also includes another important point:&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"><strong>When you realize you've made a 
mistake, cut your losses.</strong></font></p>
<p>It's just so hard to admit a mistake.&nbsp; Denial is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/item_10161.html">book</a>, Barry 
Moltz busts the myth that persistence is the most important thing for an 
entrepreneur.&nbsp; Moltz claims that winners are people who know when to 
quit.</p>
<p>I completely agree.&nbsp; We need to give ourselves the freedom to take risks 
and try a lot of different things.&nbsp; But the obvious corollary here is that 
not all of those risks will work out.&nbsp; We need to learn to quickly 
recognize the ones that don't and take the appropriate action.</p>
<p>I could write lots of stuff about the topic of risk-taking, but I <a href="/bos/Make_More_Mistakes.html">already 
have</a>.&nbsp; :-) </p>
