<P>The Law of Unpredictability says, "Unless you write your competitors' plans, 
you can't predict the future."</P>
<P>But that doesn't seem to be the main point of this chapter.&nbsp; What the 
authors are really saying is that long-range planning doesn't work.&nbsp; We can 
try to observe and follow trends.&nbsp; We can make big-picture 
predictions.&nbsp; But if we try to make detailed plans over the long term, our 
competitors will surprise us and those plans will end up getting scrapped.</P>
<P>I suspect this chapter is a lot more necessary for people like Pepsi and 
Burger King.&nbsp; Those guys probably do get tempted to make long-term 
plans.&nbsp; But in software, things move so fast that most of us wouldn't even 
think of trying to make any sort of detailed plan for a five year horizon.&nbsp; 
There are exceptions, but in general, the mere notion is absurd.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, although we intuitively know that long-term planning won't work 
for us, we don't always invest in the alternative.&nbsp; As Ries and Trout say, 
"One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of 
flexibility into your organization."</P>
<P>Flexibility is so critical in our industry, especially for a small ISV.&nbsp; 
Structure, planning&nbsp;and process have their place, but at the end of the 
day, your small ISV will probably survive largely on the basis of how well you 
can adapt to change.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Take the energy you would have used on long-range planning and use it to make 
sure your company is flexible.</P>
