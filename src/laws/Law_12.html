<P>Ouch!&nbsp; Ralph Johnson <A

I am making "snide" comments about Java marketing.&nbsp; That stings.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was one of my professors at UIUC.&nbsp; He had a significant 
impact on my life, probably more than he knows.&nbsp; He's incredibly smart, and 
he would be a finalist in the Nicest Guy on Earth competition.&nbsp; 
When&nbsp;Dr. Johnson&nbsp;whispers, it sounds loud, at least&nbsp;to me.</P>
<P>Still, despite the small rebuke from my mentor, I can't quite bring myself to 
repent.&nbsp; I'm not trying&nbsp;to be mean or arrogant, but my goodness, we're 
talking about <STRONG>Sun</STRONG> here.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>"Bummer of a birthmark,

<P>Asking me not to be critical of Java marketing is like asking me to watch a 
Jim Carrey flick and only pay attention to the supporting cast.&nbsp; Some 
things are just too obvious to ignore.</P>
<P>It's fair to observe that everything is relative.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson 
is&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;Smalltalk marketing, and I suppose Java marketing 
looks pretty effective from that point of view.&nbsp; Clearly, Java is a big 
success.&nbsp; It is a mainstream language and platform.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I 
remain&nbsp;of the opinion that Java could have been even more.</P>
<P>Remember:&nbsp; Marketing is an iceberg.&nbsp; There is the part of marketing 
you can see (advertising and communications), and the part you cannot see 
(strategy).&nbsp; We tend to forget about the part of the iceberg which is 
hidden under the water.</P>
<P>If I started writing about Sun's mistakes in marketing strategy, it would be 
an awfully long time before I ran out of things to say.&nbsp; Their marketing 
communications work is generally good.&nbsp; But in the end, the most tactful 
thing to say is that Sun is&nbsp;a hardware company trying to do software.</P>
<P>Do you remember the Far Side cartoon with the two deer?&nbsp; One of them has 
a birthmark on his chest which looks exactly like a bullseye.&nbsp; For someone 
who writes about marketing strategy, Sun is that deer.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>You hurt the ones you 
love</FONT></P>
<P>Please don't pigeonhole me as an anti-Java guy.&nbsp; Yes, I mostly do .NET 
stuff these days, but I don't get religious about technology.&nbsp; My web 
server runs Debian.&nbsp; When I repave my Windows box, the first things I 
install are cygwin and emacs.&nbsp; I sometimes write&nbsp;stuff in 
Python.&nbsp; I've written lots of Java code, and I really like it.&nbsp; I'm 
not mad at Java.&nbsp; If anything, I'm mad at Sun for doing such a fine job 
preventing Java from realizing its full potential.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Back to the topic at 
hand</FONT></P>
<P>The Law of Line Extension says that it is a mistake to&nbsp;take 
the&nbsp;name of one product and apply it to another.&nbsp; Companies do this 
often, but it basically <EM>never</EM> works.&nbsp; We think that the power of 
the brand will help sell the new product.&nbsp; Instead, the brand itself is 
tarnished.&nbsp; People start to get confused about what the brand means.&nbsp; 
Quite often it is necessary to kill&nbsp;the second product before it causes too 
much damage to&nbsp;the first one.</P>
<P>Confession:&nbsp; SourceGear broke this law when we introduced <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/soscollab/">SourceOffSite Collaborative 
Edition</A>.&nbsp; We should not have borrowed the name of <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite</A> for this product.&nbsp; 
When I critique marketing mistakes, I don't spare myself.</P>
<P>I already wrote about this law back in April when I got all <A 
href="/item_10164.html">fussy</A> about Golden 
Oreos.&nbsp; I don't have too much more to say, except...</P>
