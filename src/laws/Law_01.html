Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Leadership affirms the importance of being number one in a 
category.&nbsp; People usually know who the number one player is, but often 
cannot even name the number two.&nbsp; Tylenol is obviously the number one brand 
of acetaminophen.&nbsp; Who is number two?</P>
<P>Ries and Trout also&nbsp;claim that the first player to appear in a category 
usually ends up being the number one player.&nbsp; There are plenty of good 
examples of this.&nbsp; Chrysler brought us the first minivan and still leads 
the category.&nbsp; However, I think the authors&nbsp;overstate the importance 
of being first,&nbsp;especially in our field.&nbsp; There are just too many 
exceptions.&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Microsoft Excel was not the first spreadsheet, but it leads that category 
  today. 
  <LI>Visual Studio was not the first IDE, but it leads that category today. 
  <LI>Perl was not first completely unreadable language, but it leads that 
  category today.&nbsp; :-) </LI></UL>
<P>Anyway, the main point remains:&nbsp; There is a huge benefit to being number 
one in some category, even if you have to invent a whole new category.&nbsp; :-)
