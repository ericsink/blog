<P>I manage this weblog with a tool I wrote called <A 
href="CornSharp.html">CornSharp</A>.&nbsp; It's a 
bare-bones app which may not ever be useful for anybody but me.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> 
Nonetheless, I've had a few requests for the source code.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, I've been wrestling with an issue from my day job:&nbsp; Vault's 
integration with Visual Studio .NET really needs to improve.&nbsp; We do support 
this feature, but it has some annoyances and some performance problems.</P>
<P>In fairness to ourselves, the primary reason our IDE integration is lame is 
that <STRONG>all</STRONG> source control tools are lame when they are integrated 
into Visual Studio.&nbsp; The <STRONG>concept</STRONG> of having source control 
inside the IDE is great, but Visual Studio's implementation is really 
poor.&nbsp; The integration API is awful.&nbsp; It shoehorns every source 
control tool into a very constraining little box.&nbsp; Vault has a number of 
advanced features that don't fit in that box very well at all.</P>
<P>But there is another important reason why our IDE client suffers:&nbsp; In 
general, the developers at SourceGear&nbsp;don't use&nbsp;it.&nbsp; We&nbsp;much 
prefer&nbsp;using our standalone source control client.&nbsp; It's faster and it 
has more features.&nbsp; It allows us to take full advantage of all of Vault's 
capabilities, not just the subset which happens to fit into the source control 
UI prescribed by Visual Studio.</P>
<P>But a lot of our customers still prefer to do their source control operations 
inside the IDE.&nbsp; The IDE client is an important part of our product.&nbsp; 
It deserves to be excellent.</P>
<P>This situation is a great example of how important "<A 
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2003/02/21/2743.aspx">dogfooding</A>" 
is.&nbsp; In a nutshell, dogfooding means "using your own product".&nbsp; A 
product which is being dogfooded tends to be a lot more polished.&nbsp; When a 
normal user is annoyed by the product, they can't do anything about it.&nbsp; 
But when a developer is annoyed by the product, they&nbsp;can stop what they are 
doing and&nbsp;make the product less annoying.&nbsp;</P>
<P>So we've started trying to dogfood our IDE client more.&nbsp; We are still 
very constrained by Visual Studio's source control architecture, but within 
those boundaries, we want our IDE client to be as good as it can be.</P>
<P>As part of this effort, today I moved the CornSharp source code to <A 
href="http://vaultpub.sourcegear.com/">VaultPub</A>, and I am now using the 
Vault IDE client for its development.&nbsp; In addition to giving me another way 
to dogfood the Vault IDE client, the source code for CornSharp is now 
available.</P>
<P>(For all three of the people on earth who care, you'll need to download the 
Vault client installer so you can use it to grab a copy of the CornSharp 
code.&nbsp; Start with your browser pointed at <A 
href="http://vaultpub.sourcegear.com/">vaultpub.sourcegear.com</A> and follow 
the instructions.)</P>
