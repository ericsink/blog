My 2 cents on HP-Compaq:  Look on the bright side.  Since most mergers fail, our industry spends plenty of time asking itself why.  When this one fails, the answers will be obvious, so the postmortem can go much more quickly.  <img src="smiley.gif">
As usual, J. William Gurley's <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1072-874374.html">latest piece</a> is a good read.  He departs from his usual analysis-oriented stuff to add his anti-spam sermon to the public record.<br><br>
He's right of course, and he says it well.  Spam is frustrating and spinning out of control.<br><br>
All the truly excellent technologies are double-edged swords.  Unix is like that.  People often say that Unix does not prevent you from doing stupid things because it would also prevent you from doing clever things.<br><br>
TCP/IP is the same way.  I know we need a firewall, but 99% of the time, it's just a nuisance to the honest user who can't get through it to do his job.<br><br>
And that's the problem with spam.  Any technology solution which eliminates spam is also likely to eliminate some of the valid mail traffic as well.<br><br>
Email is a double-edged sword, but right now we're all getting knicked by the wrong side of the blade.
