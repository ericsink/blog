<P>As long as I'm being crabby today about email clients, let's talk about 
Criminally Stupid Bugs.&nbsp; I'm not talking about basic programmer 
errors.&nbsp; We all make mistakes.&nbsp; No, I'm talking about things for which 
some programmer deserves to be tarred and feathered.&nbsp; Here are a couple of 
examples:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>For the last several weeks, development builds of Vault have been 
  beeping.&nbsp; Nobody knew why, but every so often the app would just emit a 
  beep.&nbsp; It was driving people crazy.&nbsp; It turns out that we had a 
  silly bug which occasionally caused the app to try and append an empty string 
  into the user messages pane.&nbsp; This should be harmless, right?&nbsp; 
  Nope.&nbsp; It turns out that in the .NET Framework,&nbsp;if you call 
  AppendText() with an empty string on a&nbsp;RichTextBox, sometimes it 
  beeps.&nbsp; Apparently somebody at Microsoft thought&nbsp;this would be 
  cute.&nbsp; If I ever find out who it is, I'm going to invoice him for 
  the&nbsp;cost of the&nbsp;psychiatrist&nbsp;we hired to help those employees 
  here who went&nbsp;insane listening to that #^%!^% beep.<BR><BR>
  <LI>One of the third-party tools we use in our automated build system has an 
  unforgivably bad habit.&nbsp; It's a command-line tool which is being used in 
  an entirely automated fashion.&nbsp; We even pass it a special flag which 
  supposedly makes it "quiet".&nbsp; Nonetheless, every so often this tool pops 
  up a dialog box to let us know that a new version of the tool is available at 
  the vendor's website.&nbsp; This brings the entire automated build to a stop 
  until we visit the build machine and click the cancel button.&nbsp; In other 
  words, we can't do automated builds unless we're here at the office 
  to&nbsp;babysit the build machine.&nbsp; I'm not going to name the vendor 
  here, but&nbsp;I'd like to&nbsp;say a&nbsp;word to the CEO of that 
  company:&nbsp; You know who you are.&nbsp; You need to find the programmer who 
  thought this would be cute.&nbsp; Do not fire them over this, because then it 
  would be more difficult for you to torture them on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; You 
  need to keep this employee on your staff and make it a part of your corporate 
  mission to continually find new ways of making him miserable for the remainder 
  of his days.</LI></UL>
<P>I'm sure I'll be less crabby after the weekend.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">

<P>A bit begrudgingly, I am&nbsp;ready to admit that I like Outlook 2003.</P>
<P>When it comes to email clients, I am&nbsp;probably one of the fussiest people 
in the world.&nbsp; I've used lots of different email apps and most of them are 
just lame.&nbsp; I've been crabby about this topic for so long it seems like the 
last decent email client I used was Eudora 3.0.</P>
<P>If I were to rank the worst email clients I have ever tried, the various 
versions of Outlook would hold the top few spots on the list.&nbsp; Outlook 2000 
was particularly awful.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But I recently switched to Outlook 2003, and strangely enough, I actually 
like it.&nbsp; Here's why:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;feel absurdly slow like its ancestors.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It doesn't treat me like a villain for the fact that we don't use 
  Exchange.&nbsp; We've had our mail server running under Linux for ages, and 
  we've never found a compelling reason to change.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It doesn't treat me like a luddite for the fact that I don't like HTML 
  mail.&nbsp; This is the first version of Outlook which works well with 
  good-old-fashioned plain text email.&nbsp; I had&nbsp;to fiddle with the 
  options quite a bit, but the result works perfectly.&nbsp; All my incoming 
  mails are converted to plaintext.&nbsp; All my sent emails are in plaintext, 
  even if I am responding to a message in some other weirdo format.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It still lets me see HTML mail when I want to.&nbsp; Even though I have 
  all my incoming mails converted to plaintext, I can click a button in the 
  message window to show that message as HTML.&nbsp; It doesn't change my global 
  setting for other messages.&nbsp; It simply allows me to see the underlying 
  HTML.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It doesn't load inline images in HTML unless I specifically say so.&nbsp; 
  No more unwanted pictures in my face.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It has taught me that I'm not quite as good of a speller as I thought I 
  was.&nbsp; Believe it or not, I have never used a mail client with built-in 
  spell checking.&nbsp; I'm a pretty decent speller, so it hasn't been much of 
  an issue.&nbsp; But since I switched to Outlook 2003, I've been amazed at the 
  number of typos and spelling errors caught by the spell checker.&nbsp; My 
  apologies to all those people over the years who have endured as I misspelled 
  the word "<EM>committment</EM>".<BR><BR>
  <LI>It has cool flags for followup.&nbsp; I like to click the flag column to 
  mark messages which need my attention.&nbsp; Outlook 2003 keeps a special 
  folder which aggregates all my flagged items together in one view, regardless 
  of where they are located elsewhere in the folder hierarchy.&nbsp; 
  Neato.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It&nbsp;groups items in folders by day, with tree control behavior, 
  allowing me to expand and collapse a whole day's messages at one time.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NewsGator.&nbsp; I like SharpReader, but I'm now giving <A 
  href="http://www.newsgator.com/">NewsGator</A> a try.&nbsp; So far I am very 
  impressed.&nbsp; It's cool having my subscribed feeds show up right there in 
  my mail reader.</LI></UL>
