<P>Folks, I&nbsp;simply couldn't resist&nbsp;writing my blog posting on Friday 
about SourceGear applying for the VSS dev lead opening.&nbsp; But I don't want 
to mislead anybody, so I'd like to clarify:</P>
<P>I am <EM>not</EM> suggesting that anything is going on.&nbsp; Actually, the 
fact that I posted this blurb is <EM>proof</EM> that nothing is going on.&nbsp; 
When two companies are in serious discussions about acquisition, nobody is 
allowed to breathe a word about it.&nbsp; If something were going on, my blog 
posting would have been highly inappropriate.</P>
<P>My posting was just for fun.&nbsp; Around 14 years ago, I turned down an 
opportunity to spend my software career at Microsoft.&nbsp; I don't regret that 
decision, because it was the right one to make at the time.&nbsp; But it's 
always interesting to wonder about the road not taken.&nbsp; Given the right 
opportunity to become a Microsoft employee, I'd love the chance.&nbsp; I am 
somewhat of an arrogant know-it-all, so I still think I would fit right 
in.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>This stuff is just idle rambling.&nbsp; I've already got a darn good 
job.&nbsp; Our customers like using our products and we like building 
them.&nbsp; </P>
