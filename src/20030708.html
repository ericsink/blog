<P>This article is part of a series entitled "<A 
href="Marketing_for_Geeks.html">Marketing for 
Geeks</A>".&nbsp; The central theme is that if we demystify marketing, it can be 
competently done by technical people.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Most&nbsp;geeks tend to shy away from marketing, citing their lack of 
creativity and graphic design skills.&nbsp; But these are typically not the 
differentiators which determine whether marketing is competent or not.&nbsp; 
Marketing efforts tend to succeed or fail on their strategy and tactics, not on 
their artwork.&nbsp; Before you start designing logos or&nbsp;wordsmithing your 
ad copy, you need&nbsp;to do three things:</P>
<OL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Pick a market segment and make sure you will be 
  facing competition of the right kind.<BR>(see: <A 
  href="Choose_Your_Competition.html">Choose Your 
  Competition</A>)<BR><BR></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Figure out what position you want to have. 
  <BR>(see: <A href="Positioning.html">Marketing is 
  not a Post-Processing Step</A>)<BR><BR></DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Understand the four stages in the life of your 
  product's market. <BR>(this article:&nbsp; Act Your Age)</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>The first two steps were explained in previous articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;In both, 
you have the luxury of choices.&nbsp; You get to choose your market 
segment.&nbsp; You get to define your product's position.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But step three is something that happens to your product whether you like it 
or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not unlike&nbsp;the natural aging process we experience as 
human beings, our products go through various stages of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;In both 
cases, the only way to avoid the next stage is death, so we might as well learn 
to handle these stages with&nbsp;a measure of grace.&nbsp; </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Four Groups</FONT></P>
<P>The people in&nbsp;your market&nbsp;segment are divided into four groups:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><STRONG>Early Adopters</STRONG> are risk takers who actually <EM>like</EM> 
  to try new things.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Pragmatists</STRONG> <EM>might</EM>&nbsp;be willing to use new 
  technology, if it's the only way to get their problem solved.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Conservatives</STRONG> dislike new technology and try to 
  <EM>avoid</EM> it.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Laggards</STRONG> pride themselves on the fact that they are the 
  last to try anything new.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Marketing textbooks usually draw these groups using a bell curve, something 
like this:</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="bell.gif"></P>
<P>The bell curve highlights two important things:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>1.&nbsp; The middle two groups account for most of your potential 
  customers.</P>
  <P>2.&nbsp; You can only get these customers in order, moving from left to 
  right.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Each of the four groups has its own behavior which determines when they will 
buy your product:</P>
<UL dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <LI>The Early Adopters don't need much convincing.&nbsp; Some of them will try 
  your product just because it's new.&nbsp; They don't wait for anybody else's 
  endorsement.&nbsp; They are leaders who prefer to be on the bleeding edge of 
  technology.<BR><BR>
  <LI>The Pragmatists will only buy your product when they see other Pragmatists 
  doing it.&nbsp; If this sounds like a chicken-and-egg paradox, it is.&nbsp; 
  We'll talk more about this problem below.<BR><BR>
  <LI>The Conservatives will buy your product only after they see that the 
  Pragmatists are happy with it.<BR><BR>
  <LI>There is no way to predict the behavior of the Laggards.&nbsp; They may 
  never buy your product.&nbsp; You can safely ignore them.&nbsp; If your 
  product gets to the point where you are selling to the Laggards, you will no 
  longer be in charge of marketing at your company.&nbsp; Your company&nbsp;has 
  become&nbsp;quite successful.&nbsp; You&nbsp;are 
  semi-retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;have hired&nbsp;a marketing&nbsp;VP&nbsp;and 
  assigned&nbsp;him ridiculous and unattainable goals just so you can 
  watch&nbsp;him squirm.</LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>The Chasm</FONT></P>
<P>To be successful, you eventually have to sell your product to the Pragmatists 
and Conservatives, but these two groups behave very differently from the groups 
on the ends of the bell curve.&nbsp; Specifically, the middle two groups 
function with a "herd mentality".&nbsp; They are followers.&nbsp; They only buy 
when they see somebody else doing it.</P>
<P>The Conservatives are actually not&nbsp;all that&nbsp;difficult.&nbsp; They 
watch the Pragmatists very closely.&nbsp; They'll start buying after most of the 
Pragmatists are happy with your product.&nbsp; You don't have to do any special 
gymnastics to attract the Conservatives.&nbsp; Once the Pragmatists like you, 
then the Conservatives will follow.</P>
<P>The Pragmatists are the real problem group.&nbsp; They are followers, but the 
only people they're willing to follow are each other.&nbsp; It's tempting to 
think they will simply wait for the group ahead of them to like your product, 
but it's not true.&nbsp; The endorsement of the Early Adopters is not 
enough.&nbsp; Like a junior high dance, the Pragmatists are&nbsp;watching each 
other, waiting for somebody else to make the first move.</P>
<P>This dynamic is very well explained by Geoffrey Moore in his outstanding book 
<A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060517123/sawdust08-20">Crossing 
the Chasm</A>.&nbsp; Moore argues that the classic marketing bell curve is 
wrong, and should actually be rendered more like this:</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="bell2.gif"></P>
<P>This drawing reflects the fact that there is no smooth or logical transition 
between the Early Adopters and the Pragmatists.&nbsp; In between the Early 
Adopters and the Pragmatists there is a chasm.&nbsp; To successfully sell your 
product to the Pragmatists, you&nbsp;must "cross the chasm".&nbsp; </P>
<P>But if the Pragmatists won't buy until they see each other doing it, how we 
get across?</P>
<P>The key is to find a Pragmatist who is desperate, or as Moore says, a 
"Pragmatist in Pain".&nbsp; They have a problem, and they need it solved very 
badly.&nbsp; In fact, they are so desperate for a solution that they are willing 
to break ranks with their Pragmatist&nbsp;peers and be the first of their kind 
to try your product.</P>
<P>You need to have a&nbsp;very special relationship with your&nbsp;Pragmatist 
in Pain.&nbsp; They don't like working with small ISVs.&nbsp; They prefer to buy 
from larger vendors with established reputations.&nbsp; By choosing to buy your 
product, they are sponsoring you across the chasm.&nbsp; You don't really 
deserve to be on the other side, and they know that.</P>
<P>So you have to treat them like they are very special.&nbsp; Give them 
everything they want, almost&nbsp;as if they were&nbsp;ordering a custom 
application.&nbsp; You may have to implement special features just for 
them.&nbsp; You may have to give them substantial discounts.&nbsp; You 
should&nbsp;visit their site and meet them in person.&nbsp; You may have to 
install your product for them.&nbsp; Financially, this one customer will 
probably be a net loss.&nbsp; That's okay.&nbsp; Don't stop until they're 
happy.&nbsp; And then keep them happy, as your corporate lips are going to be 
more or less permanently sewn to their corporate rear end.</P>
<P>Since crossing the chasm is so difficult, you might be tempted to think you 
can just stay on the left side.&nbsp; Maybe the Early Adopters represent a 
market which is big enough for your product?&nbsp; Sorry, but this won't 
work.&nbsp; The Early Adopters like <EM>new</EM> things, and your product is 
getting older every day.&nbsp; If you try to build your product's entire life on 
the Early Adopters, you take the risk that they will abandon you for somebody 
else who proclaims to have the latest cool thing.&nbsp; In the long run, it's 
not safe to remain on the left side of the chasm.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>A Few Examples</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite</A> has crossed the 
  chasm.&nbsp; Life is <EM>very</EM> good over here.&nbsp; Most of the Fortune 
  500 is on our customer list.&nbsp; The product is extremely 
profitable.<BR><BR>
  <LI>But <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</A> is 
  still pre-chasm.&nbsp; We've shipped our 1.0 release and the Early Adopters 
  love it.&nbsp; We're now finishing up a 1.1 release which contains a number of 
  improvements, but this release won't get us across. Luckily, the SourceSafe 
  world is filled with many Pragmatists in Pain.&nbsp; We're talking to several 
  of them as we work on our 2.0 release.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Microsoft Windows has obviously moved way beyond the chasm.<BR><BR>
  <LI>But <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/crm">Microsoft CRM</A> is definitely 
  still over in the land of the Early Adopters.&nbsp; The Redmond giant can 
  cross the chasm more easily than you or I, but they still have to do it.&nbsp; 
  And just like everybody else's stuff, most new Microsoft products don't cross 
  over until version 3.0.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Some of my fellow .NET fans will disagree with me, but I consider .NET to 
  be pre-chasm.&nbsp; Will .NET 2.0 arrive on the other side of the chasm, one 
  version number earlier than usual?&nbsp; Maybe.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Java is definitely post-chasm.<BR><BR>
  <LI>DVD players are post-chasm.&nbsp; In fact, my parents recently got a DVD 
  player, so this market is evidently starting to&nbsp;attract the 
  Laggards.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"><BR><BR>
  <LI>What about Weblogs?&nbsp; Pre or post chasm?&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the 
  dramatic rise in popularity over the last couple years, I'd&nbsp;have to say 
  weblogs are still pre-chasm, with most of their potential yet to be 
  realized.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Digital cameras have crossed the chasm, just&nbsp;in the last couple of 
  years or so.<BR><BR>
  <LI>PDAs crossed the chasm, and then somehow lost their balance and fell back 
  into the abyss.<img src="smiley.gif"></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Act Your Age</FONT></P>
<P>Don't get yourself in a big hurry.&nbsp; The timeframe spanned by this bell 
curve is usually measured in years, not weeks or months.&nbsp; These 
four&nbsp;groups and the transitions between them represent distinct stages in 
the life of your product.&nbsp; Each of those stages is very different, and 
things will go much better if you behave appropriately&nbsp;at each stage of 
your product's life.</P>
<P>Nine year old girls don't wear heavy makeup.&nbsp; Sixty-five year olds don't 
start bachelor's degrees.&nbsp; Thirty-two year olds don't stay up all night 
like they did ten years before.&nbsp; (And yes, there are exceptions to each of 
these rules.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">)</P>
<P>Similarly, products need to act their age.&nbsp; Choosing features is a part 
of marketing.&nbsp; When you decide what features to include in each release, 
you need to keep your product's current life stage in mind.&nbsp; Here are a few 
examples of what this might mean:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>To attract the Early Adopters, your product needs to be cool and 
  new.&nbsp;&nbsp;To attract the Conservatives it needs to be boring 
  and&nbsp;well-established.<BR><BR>
  <LI>When pursuing the Early Adopters, don't spend time putting in features 
  that only the Conservatives care about.<BR><BR>
  <LI>As described above, to keep your sponsoring Pragmatist happy, you will 
  have to do basically everything they want.&nbsp; But you probably 
  can't&nbsp;give that kind of treatment to everyone on the&nbsp;other side of 
  the chasm.&nbsp; There are too many Pragmatists and Conservatives to meet 
  their needs one at a time.<BR><BR>
  <LI>In the Early Adopters stage, listen.&nbsp; Many of these folks are 
  technologists like you.&nbsp; They're smart, they're interested in your 
  product, they&nbsp;speak your language, and they have good ideas.&nbsp; Get in 
  a dialogue with them, and pay attention.<BR><BR>
  <LI>In the Pragmatists and Conservatives stage, listen even more 
  carefully.&nbsp; These people are nothing like you.&nbsp; You're a geek and 
  you enjoy technology for its own sake.&nbsp; They just want their problems 
  solved, and they don't care in the slightest about the religious wars we fight 
  amongst ourselves.&nbsp; Don't assume you know anything about the problems 
  they're facing.&nbsp; Oh and by the way, we're the ones who are abnormal, not 
  them.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Remember, Pragmatists are practical.&nbsp; They want no-nonsense solutions 
  to <EM>their</EM> problems.&nbsp; If you throw in a feature just because one 
  of your developers thinks it was cool, the Pragmatists will not be 
  impressed.<BR><BR>
  <LI>If you're selling to the Conservatives, don't start making gratuitous 
  changes.&nbsp; Conservatives are like cats -- if you move too fast, you'll 
  scare them.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></LI></UL>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">My apologies to fans of <A

marketing to other geeks, so it seems prudent not to exceed the available 
precision.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </FONT></P>
