<p><strong>Eric, are you still using and maintaining CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>No.  I now use <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/citydesk/">CityDesk</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>CornSharp is a tool for editing and publishing a weblog.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What are its key features?</strong></p>
<ul dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
<ul>
    <li>Works with any web server.&nbsp; CornSharp generates static HTML files 
    and requires no dynamic content generation on the web server.
</li>
<li>Written entirely in C#.
</li>
<li>RSS 2.0 support.
</li>
<li>Date-oriented index of all items.
</li>
<li>Supports regular weblog items as well as "Feature" items.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Isn't that terribly inefficient, copying all those files up to the 
server every time something changes?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>CornSharp only uploads the files that have changed.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Can&nbsp;it publish with passive FTP?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Can&nbsp;it publish with active FTP?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>No.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Can&nbsp;it publish with SSH?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Not any more.&nbsp; This feature was originally present, but it used a 
  proprietary component, so I removed the feature when I released the source 
  code.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is it called "CornSharp"?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Primarily, because nothing <em>else</em> is called CornSharp.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif" />
</p>
  <p>Seriously, I didn't put a great deal of thought into the name.&nbsp; I 
  included "Sharp" because several other .NET-centric freebie applications have 
  that word in the name.&nbsp; The word "Corn" is included because I live in 
  Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, which is essentially in the middle of a giant 
  cornfield.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Isn't "CornSharp" the dumbest name ever?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Yeah, I thought "eBay" was a dumb name when I first heard it.&nbsp; 
  Just wait until CornSharp achieves its goal of total world domination -- the 
  name won't sound quite so dumb then.<img src="/smiley.gif" /></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is the version number 0.5?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Calling it version 1.0 would have been audacious.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Does CornSharp have themes or skins so I can completely change the 
way my weblog looks?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Sorry, no.&nbsp; CornSharp offers you a limited amount of control over the 
  appearance of your weblog, but the general layout cannot currently be 
  changed.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Aren't you&nbsp;with&nbsp;SourceGear?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Yep.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is this a SourceGear product?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Definitely not.&nbsp; SourceGear sells version control tools.&nbsp; We have 
  no plans to get into the market for blogging tools.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I call SourceGear for support?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Please don't.&nbsp; They had nothing to do with this.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif" />
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why did you write CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>For the fun of it.&nbsp; I use lots of software from various sources, but I 
  also like using software that I wrote for myself.&nbsp; Some people call it 
  "Not Invented Here" syndrome, but I think of it as craftsmanship.&nbsp; I'm a 
  programmer, so I wrote my own blog tool.&nbsp; I'm also a woodworker, so I 
  built my own desk.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Will you add a new feature if I ask for it?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Probably not.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif" /> Seriously, you can ask, but I'm not making 
  any promises.&nbsp; Writing CornSharp is a spare time activity for me.&nbsp; 
  My day job keeps me plenty busy too.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Will you fix bugs in CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Maybe.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I call you on the phone for tech support on 
CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Nope.&nbsp; This software comes with No Warranty, No Support, and No 
  Promises.<img src="/smiley.gif" /></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><strong>Can I email you about 
CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Sure.&nbsp; My email address is <a href="mailto:eric@sourcegear.com">eric@sourcegear.com</a>.&nbsp; I try to 
  answer all my email, but sometimes things slip through the cracks when I get 
  really swamped.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why does CornSharp generate static HTML files?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Because I wanted a tool which can work with <em>any</em> web server.&nbsp; 
  My personal web server is a Linux box.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Your webserver is running on Linux?&nbsp; Is something wrong with 
you?&nbsp; Don't you like ASP.NET?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Guilty, I suppose.&nbsp; I'm a .NET-fanatic, and ASP.NET is very cool, but 
  I've been&nbsp;running my personal server on Debian Linux for years and 
  I&nbsp;just can't bring myself to switch it over to Windows.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you implement the FTP feature?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>I used some <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ftplibrary.asp?target=ftpclient">code</a> 
  I found on CodeProject.com, written by somebody named Dan Glass.&nbsp; I've 
  made no changes to this code, and it seems to work fine.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you implement the WYSIWYG HTML editor?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>I started with code I found <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/htmleditor/index.php">here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What's wrong with all the other blogging tools?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Nothing.&nbsp; I've used Radio, and it seems okay.&nbsp; I've never tried 
  MovableType.&nbsp; I like <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/default.aspx">.Text</a>, but I wanted a 
  client-side-only alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why isn't the output XHTML-compliant?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Sorry, I just haven't gotten around to fixing this yet.&nbsp; It may be 
  difficult to fix, since the WYSIWYG editor generates lame HTML.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What does the Sidebar button do?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>The Sidebar button brings up an HTML editor.&nbsp; Anything you type here 
  will be included in the left sidebar of every page on your weblog 
site.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Will CornSharp manage my BlogRoll?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>There is no special support for managing a blogroll, but you can use the 
  Sidebar feature to include anything you like.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I want my weblog to have a form where users can send me email.&nbsp; 
Can CornSharp do this?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>No.&nbsp; This would require CGI or ASP or something like that.&nbsp; 
  CornSharp weblogs are pure static HTML, nothing more.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can my weblog have a discussion board where people can post 
comments?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">No.&nbsp; This would require CGI or ASP or something like 
  that.&nbsp; CornSharp weblogs are pure static HTML, nothing 
more.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Does CornSharp work with </strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/vbtchNo-TouchDeploymentInNETFramework.asp"><strong>No-Touch 
Deployment</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">No.&nbsp; Currently CornSharp expects to be installed on your 
  desktop system and store your weblog data files there.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What if I want to blog from two different 
machines?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Right now CornSharp doesn't work well under that scenario.&nbsp; I 
  suggest using a server-based solution.&nbsp; I hope to update CornSharp to 
  work well with No-Touch Deployment in a future release.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How is my weblog data stored?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">All your weblog items are stored in a single XML file.&nbsp; 
  Attachments and images are stored separately.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you planning to charge money for CornSharp in the 
future?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Nope.&nbsp; I already have a <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">job</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can't CornSharp remember my blog file so I don't have to 
"Open Weblog" every time I run the app?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">I don't have an MRU list, but there is a simple workaround.&nbsp; 
  The CornSharp executable is called CornGUI.exe and it will accept a command 
  line argument which specifies the weblog XML file to be opened.&nbsp; Create a 
  shortcut on your desktop which includes the argument and then use that 
  shortcut to open CornSharp.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can CornSharp integrate with any version control system so I 
can keep track of the revision history of my blog data?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Not yet.&nbsp; If I ever add this feature, you can probably guess 
  which <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">version control tool</a> I 
  plan to support first.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif" /> </p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you going to build an aggregator into CornSharp in a 
future release?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Probably not.&nbsp; I use NewsGator and I like it just fine.&nbsp; 
  I've used SharpReader too and liked it as well.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Any plans to put a spell checker into the built-in HTML 
editor?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Probably not.&nbsp; I'll admit that I wish it had one.&nbsp; I find 
  that I use it more than I thought I would.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you going to make CornSharp support the Blogger 
API?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">Probably not.</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How can I get CornSharp?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p dir="ltr">The source code is hosted on <a href="http://vaultpub.sourcegear.com/">VaultPub</a>.</p>
