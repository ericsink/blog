<p>People often ask me for a list of my favorite books.&nbsp; So
here it is.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I reserve the right to update this list from time to time.</p>

<p>I tend to read a <i>lot</i> of stuff.&nbsp; The fact that I
recommend a book here does not mean that I agree with everything in it.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>I think it's out of print, but I really liked <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556155514/sawdust08-20">Writing
Solid Code</a>.&nbsp; It's very oriented toward C/C++, so if you're mostly in
C#/Java/Ruby/Python/Perl/VB, it may not be worth your time.&nbsp; Still, it's an
outstanding book.</p>

<p>And of course <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670/sawdust08-20">Code
Complete</a> is a classic.</p>

<h3>Software Management</h3>

<p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735623198/sawdust08-20">Dynamics
of Software Development</a> is one of my favorites.</p>

<h3>Business</h3>

<p>I'm a big fan of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060566108/sawdust08-20">Built to
Last</a> and its sequel, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/sawdust08-20">Good to
Great</a>.&nbsp; The sequel is easier to read and a bit more relevant to smaller
companies.</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761521747/sawdust08-20">The
Silicon Valley Way</a> is a great book, and it's a very visual book with nice
short chapters.&nbsp; Easy to just pick up and browse..</p>

<p>If you get the opportunity, go hear Guy Kawasaki speak.&nbsp; He's
much better in person than he is on paper.&nbsp; But if that doesn't work out, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/088730995X/sawdust08-20">Rules for
Revolutionaries</a> is a good read.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>If you read only one book on marketing, it should be <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060517123/sawdust08-20">Crossing
the Chasm</a>.</p>

<p>But actually you should read at least a dozen books on
marketing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Here's your second one: &nbsp;<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471028924/sawdust08-20">Differentiate
or Die</a></p>

<p>Now go find ten more.</p>

<h3>Sales</h3>

<p>I think <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684856018/sawdust08-20">Selling
the Wheel</a> is an outstanding book.&nbsp; At first you'll be tempted to stop
because it's kind of cheesy.&nbsp; Don't.&nbsp; Finish it all the way to the end.</p>

<h3>Useless but Enjoyable Fluff</h3>

<p>I really like the "Prey" series of novels by John Sandford.&nbsp;
Start at the beginning with <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425205819/sawdust08-20">Rules of
Prey</a></p>

<h3>WPF</h3>

<p>I have all of the following WPF books:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The one by <a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596510373/sawdust08-20">Chris
     Sells and Ian Griffiths</a></li>
 <li >The one by <a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672328917/sawdust08-20">Adam
     Nathan</a></li>
 <li >The one by <a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619573/sawdust08-20">Charles
     Petzold</a></li>
 <li >The other one by Charles Petzold, <a
     href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735623945/sawdust08-20">focused
     on WPF 3D</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are all good, each in a different way.&nbsp; If you're
going to do anything serious with WPF, it seems to me that you should own them
all.</p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<p>The <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743269519/sawdust08-20">Seven
Habits of Highly Effective People</a> is still worth reading.&nbsp; None of Covey's
other books are nearly as good.</p>

<p>Any serious pool player has a copy of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156005549/sawdust08-20">Byrne's
New Standard Book of Pool and Billiards</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite literary novel is <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140449264/sawdust08-20">The Count
of Monte Cristo</a>.&nbsp; The unabridged version is worth the extra trouble.</p>

<p>For dog lovers, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060817097/sawdust08-20">Marley
&amp; Me</a> is terrific.</p>
