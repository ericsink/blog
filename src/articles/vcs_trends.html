title: Obstacles to an enterprise DVCS

<p>On 26 January 2010 I gave a presentation to <a
href="http://softwaregr.org/">Software GR</a>.&nbsp; The talk was an overview of
several trends that we have seen in the version control tools market over the
last 40 years.&nbsp; I often like to follow a talk like this by publishing the same
content here on my blog in the form of a complete article.&nbsp; This time I think
I'll just eliminate a lot of the <a
href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr">tldr</a> problem
and summarize the highlights:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>The two big trends in version
     control today are Integration and Decentralization.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Integration is driven by ALM.&nbsp;
     It is the desire to have all tools used by a development team fully
     integrated together.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Decentralization is driven by
     the recent wave of DVCS tools like Git and Mercurial.&nbsp; They offer
     compelling benefits such as performance, a different kind of scalability,
     and more flexible workflows.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>The ALM trend is happening in
     the enterprise market.&nbsp; Enterprises want everything integrated with
     everything else, and they want everything to support their ability to
     enforce process.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>The DVCS trend is happening in
     the open source community.&nbsp; Born of the legendary cat fight between
     BitKeeper and the Linux kernel developers, Git and Mercurial are maturing
     and gathering momentum at a remarkable rate.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>These two trends are going to
     clash in a big way.&nbsp; SourceGear's graphic designer drew me a nice diagram
     to depict this.<br>
     <img border=0 width=576 height=439 src="/scm/1775_image001.jpg"></li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>The two trends cannot stay
     separate.&nbsp; Each one has advantages which are too important for the other community
     to ignore.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>But the two trends and their
     respective communities are a bit like oil and water.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Enterprises want tools that
     constrain.&nbsp; The open source community wants tools that empower.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>The benefits of a DVCS would
     be diluted by integrating it with a bunch of other tools that are highly
     centralized.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Enterprises need a least a
     little centralization for things like user administration.&nbsp; In their eyes,
     complete decentralization without accountability and auditing features is
     a bug.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Even as enterprise attitudes
     about open source are changing, that change is happening slowly, and the
     GPL (used by both Git and Mercurial) is still considered the scariest
     license.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>So Git and Mercurial are not even
     close to being enterprise-ready.&nbsp; Similarly, none of the leading
     enterprise ALM tools are even close to being a DVCS.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>I believe that the main enterprise
     ALM providers (IBM/Rational, Microsoft, Serena and Borland) will all
     attempt to add DVCS features to their products.&nbsp; At least two of these
     companies (IBM/Rational, in a talk by Jean-Michel Lemieux at the Rational
     Conference in 2009, and <a
     href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2010/01/27/codeplex-now-supports-mercurial.aspx">Microsoft</a>)
     have already made public remarks about a desire to move in that direction.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>And I predict that they will
     all fail.&nbsp; It is impossible to turn any of these systems into a true DVCS
     without a nearly complete rewrite.&nbsp; The D in DVCS is not a feature which
     can be added.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>But all of them will do it
     anyway, by making compromises.&nbsp; They will try to add "just enough"
     Decentralization.&nbsp; Some of their customers will find the results to be
     sufficient.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Meanwhile, the true DVCS tools
     will continue to move forward, but their progress toward credible ALM will
     be slow.&nbsp; Enterprise-level integration is grunge work, not the kind of coding
     that hackers do as a labor of love.&nbsp; Nobody does this stuff without
     getting paid.</li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>So these two trends will
     continue to be distinct for a while, but the pressure and tension between
     them will remain, and the areas of overlap are going to continue getting
     messier.</li>
</ul>
