<P>Earlier today I was fiddling with my blog software and the way I post things 
to my web server.&nbsp; In the process, lots of items in my RSS feed now appear 
to be new, even though they are not.&nbsp; Since I switched my aggregator to 
NewsGator, I've realized how annoying it is when a site does this.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My apologies.&nbsp; I'll try not to make a habit of this.</P>
