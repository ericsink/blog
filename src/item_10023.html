I still can't quite believe it.  This afternoon I was lied to, by a grown-up.<br><br>
I rushed across O'Hare as fast as I could, from the H concourse to the G concourse, arriving just in time for flight 4317 back home to Champaign.  Or so I thought.<br><br>
I arrived at 1:22pm, and the flight was already closed, even though American Airlines policy should have prohibited the gate attendant from closing the flight until 1:24pm.  After the flight was gone and the gate attendant returned, I asked her two questions:  First, what time did you close the flight.  She looked in her computer and told me 1:25pm.  Second, what time does your computer show now?  She told me 1:40pm, even though my watch showed 1:32pm.<br><br>
I went to another gate and checked the facts.  American's computer clearly shows that the flight was closed several minutes prior to 1:24pm, in violation of their policy.  Furthermore, my watch and their computer were within 1 minute of each other, not the 8 minute difference claimed by the other agent.<br><br>
That American Airlines employee lied to me, twice.<br><br>
The inconvenience of missing my flight felt quite minor compared to the bald-faced dishonesty.  I guess you can call me old-fashioned, but I consider that to be inexcusable.<br><br>
In the course of running my business, I have made all kinds of mistakes.  I can think of several occasions where we failed to meet a customer's expectations, but I believe we have always held the truth as a high standard.<br><br>
Never, <b>never</b> lie to your customers.
