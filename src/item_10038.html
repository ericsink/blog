I see lots of people on the Web claiming that AOL is stupid for wanting to buy Red Hat.  They think AOL was stupid for buying Netscape too.<br><br>
I think AOL knows exactly what they're doing.  They have a 130B market cap and they are Microsoft's number one enemy.  Microsoft wishes they had the kind of revenue stream that AOL has.  You don't get to that kind of position with a string of stupid moves.<br><br>
AOL lives under the radar of many geeks.  I usually recommend them when normal people ask me how to get on the Internet.  But I've never even used AOL, and most people like me haven't.  We just don't pay much attention to them.  We don't think of AOL as a software company and we don't think of MSFT as an ISP.<br><br>
I wonder if normal people have that distinction in their mind?
