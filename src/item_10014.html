title: No cable modems out in the country
---

Finally!  Our family moved this weekend to a house which has been under construction for about a year.  We're living out of cardboard boxes.<br><br>
Our new place is out in the country.  We've got no city water, no natural gas service, and no cable TV.  None of that is a problem.  The scary thing was:  No broadband.<br><br>
Right now we've solved that problem with <a href="http://www.prairieinet.net/">Prairie iNet</a>.  We've got a fixed wireless Internet connection from our house to the top of a grain elevator in Dewey, Illinois.  The stated range of this antenna is 4.5 miles, but ours is functioning pretty well at 8 miles away.  I've got ~60 ms ping times to the SourceGear web server which is colo-ed in St. Louis.  The connection is a little bit flaky in the afternoons, when I suddenly start seeing up to 50% packet loss.  At other times of day, it seems rock solid.
