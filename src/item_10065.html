Greetings!  This is the very first posting here on my new weblog.  I have seeded the article links on the left with content from my previous weblog endeavors.<br><br>

This weblog is a Python CGI script I wrote from scratch.  It stores all my content in plain XML files.  The feature set is rather minimalist.  The whole script is only 483 lines of Python.  <tt>:-)</tt>

Today is a banner day for another reason:  For the first time, I believe I now understand XML namespaces.  I've been using XML for a long time, but in order to really understand the purpose of namespaces, I had to get over my prejudice against colons in element names.<br><br>Why does everyone describe SOAP as a <b>lightweight</b> protocol?  In fact, the very first line of the SOAP 1.1 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">spec</a> uses the word lightweight.  How can it be lightweight when it often has <a href="http://www.mssoapinterop.org/asmx/simple.asmx?op=echoInteger">five long URIs</a> at the top of every message?<br><br>
Could somebody give me an example of a heavyweight protocol?
