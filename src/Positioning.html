<p>In many <a href="/Small_ISV_Defined.html">small
ISVs</a>, including SourceGear, the founder has a technical background with 
little or no marketing experience.&nbsp; This kind of company tends to become 
very programmer-centric.&nbsp; We coders think of ourselves as the center of the 
universe.&nbsp; Everything else is secondary to the code.&nbsp; The code is 
king.&nbsp; The code is the only thing we actually sell.&nbsp; If we had to get 
rid of everything else, the code would be enough.&nbsp; If we are honest enough 
to admit it, even <a href="/No_Programmers.html">true developers</a> have 
these evil thoughts from time to time.&nbsp; That's okay.&nbsp; Most lies have a 
tiny grain of truth buried inside anyway.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Our code-centric perspective makes it is easier to believe&nbsp;the common 
misconception that marketing begins when coding ends.&nbsp; Good marketing just 
doesn't work this way.&nbsp; Marketing is not a post-processing step.</p>
<p>Like many other things, marketing is somewhat like an iceberg.&nbsp; The part 
sticking out of the water is highly visible.&nbsp; It's easy to not realize that 
much of the iceberg is hidden from our view.&nbsp; When we see great beer 
commercials on TV during the Super Bowl, we think that's marketing.&nbsp; And it 
is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But there is more.&nbsp; You&nbsp;really should start&nbsp;thinking about 
marketing as soon as you start thinking about requirements, architecture or 
design.&nbsp; To understand why, bear with me for a few minutes of marketing 
mumbo-jumbo as we talk about "positioning".</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Positioning</font></p>
<p>The basic idea of positioning is that your product occupies a place in the 
mind of the people in your target market.&nbsp; You are defined by their 
perceptions of you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's try to explain this by using an example:&nbsp; Windows XP has a 
position which I would describe like this:</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">The most popular operating system for desktop 
PCs</font></p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that when you describe a position, the first 
word is usually "the", a definite article.&nbsp; Only one product can occupy a 
given position in the mind of the market.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Describing a position has three important parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, describing a position almost always includes a <em>superlative</em> 
  of some kind.&nbsp; In this case, the superlative is "most popular", but I 
  could have said "number one".&nbsp; Often people can remember only the first 
  and best thing in a category.&nbsp; Being number 6 in your market segment is 
  probably not a position at all.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Second, a&nbsp;position will describe what <em>label</em> the market 
  places on your product.&nbsp; In this case, the label is "operating system", 
  which fits just fine.&nbsp; If there is no label which fits your product, you 
  have a big problem.&nbsp; If the market cannot compare your product to 
  something else, then you don't have a position.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Third, the position will have <em>qualifiers</em> which define exactly 
  what group of people have this perspective of a product.&nbsp; In our example, 
  the market segment is "for&nbsp;desktop PCs".&nbsp; This position doesn't say 
  anything about operating systems for enterprise servers or mobile 
phones.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another view of positioning is to ask in which market segment you want to be 
known as number one.&nbsp; You want to be known as the best of your breed, even 
if you&nbsp;need&nbsp;several qualifiers to&nbsp;constrain the scope of your 
claim.&nbsp; Don't think about being&nbsp;fifth place&nbsp;in a large 
market.&nbsp; Instead, be&nbsp;number one&nbsp;in a smaller market.&nbsp; 
Apple's Macintosh is a distant number two in desktop computer platforms, but 
they are number one among graphic designers.</p>
<p>Radio stations understand positioning very well.&nbsp; Obviously most small 
ISVs do not buy radio advertising time, but if you did, you would discover that 
every radio station&nbsp;claims to be number one in their 
local&nbsp;market.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)&nbsp; One of them is&nbsp;the&nbsp;number 
one&nbsp;station for males 45 and up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another station is&nbsp;number 
one with&nbsp;secretaries who listen at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is the 
top&nbsp;radio station for classic rock.</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">"Some of these rules can be 
bent.&nbsp; Others can be broken."</font></p>
<p>I can already hear somebody saying, "But I can't be number one in 
<em>any</em> market.&nbsp; Isn't it okay to position my product as number 
two?"&nbsp; Yes, sort of.</p>
<p>Marketing isn't like coding.&nbsp; Programmers tend to see everything in 
black and white terms.&nbsp; After all, a bit is either 1 or 0.&nbsp; But 
marketing can involve a lot of grey areas.&nbsp; The so-called "rules of 
marketing" can often be altered if you have enough creativity and cash.</p>
<p>Yes, strictly speaking, it is possible to have a position as number 
two.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.avis.com/">Avis</a> did it very well with their 
slogan "We're number two -- we try harder".&nbsp; Most people know that Pepsi is 
the&nbsp;#2 cola.</p>
<p>Similarly, a product can occasionally succeed even though the market doesn't 
know how to label it.&nbsp; When Hypercard first came out,&nbsp;everybody kept 
telling&nbsp;me how <em>cool</em> it was, even though nobody could actually tell 
me <em>what</em> it was.</p>
<p>But small ISVs probably don't have the marketing budget necessary to create 
groundbreaking campaigns which rewrite conventional wisdom.&nbsp; Stick with the 
fundamentals.</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">What position do we have right 
now?</font></p>
<p>For established products and companies, there is often a difference between 
the position you want and the position you already have.&nbsp; Many press 
releases start out with something like "XYZ Corporation, the leading provider of 
blah blah blah, ...".&nbsp; Press releases and corporate websites 
often&nbsp;communicate the position that somebody wants, not necessarily the 
position they actually have.</p>
<p>If you already have a position, the first thing to do is understand it.&nbsp; 
Whether you like it or not, this is your starting point.&nbsp; In some cases 
your current position will make it much more difficult to get the position you 
want.&nbsp; If you start proclaiming your new position, the market will get 
confused and resist, because their perceptions of you are already set:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I once saw a successful mid-sized accounting firm try to expand into 
  strategic consulting.&nbsp; The market resisted their attempt to change 
  positions, saying things like&nbsp;"You're an accountant.&nbsp; I don't 
  understand why you would want to offer strategic advice?"<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Here in the midwest we've got a chain of video rental stores called <a href="http://www.famvid.com/">Family Video</a>.&nbsp; I get the impression 
  they are reasonably successful.&nbsp; But for some reason they are now trying 
  to <a href="http://www.famvid.com/inet/index.html">become an ISP</a>.&nbsp; I 
  don't see how this is going to work out.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Even Michael Dell can't seem to leave well enough alone.&nbsp; Dell's 
  position as a top-notch PC vendor is quite solid, but they recently decided to 
  <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1041-999791.html">change their name</a> from 
  Dell Computer to just Dell, reflecting their desire to be known as a "diverse 
  supplier of technology products and services".&nbsp; This will be an uphill 
  battle.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another problem is companies that seem to be living in denial.&nbsp; They 
have a solid position in the mind of the market, but they keep trying to tell us 
their position is something else.&nbsp; Consider the following example:&nbsp; 
What is the leading software application for editing photos?&nbsp; Obviously the 
answer is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</a>, 
right?&nbsp; (I don't have any idea who number two is.)</p>
<p>Now, what market position does&nbsp;Jasc <a href="http://www.jasc.com/products/paintshoppro/">Paint Shop Pro</a> 
occupy?&nbsp; I think of this app as "the number&nbsp;one low end photo editing 
software".&nbsp; It's a great product.&nbsp; For $99, I get all the 
functionality that I care about.&nbsp; I think most other people think of them 
this way too.&nbsp; This is their position.</p>
<p>And yet, their website doesn't proclaim the position we all know them to 
have.&nbsp; It describes Paint Shop Pro as "The Most Complete Photo and Graphics 
Editor".&nbsp; Look again -- does that really say "Most complete"?&nbsp; Surely 
not.&nbsp; Obviously PhotoShop is the most complete, right?</p>
<p>Jasc's&nbsp;website makes me wonder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they actually not 
understand the position their&nbsp;product already has?&nbsp; Or do they just 
not like it?&nbsp; Paint Shop Pro is an outstanding app, but it's chances of 
taking Photoshop's position are about the same as my chances of running a 
four-minute mile.&nbsp; Why not celebrate and affirm the solid position they've 
already got?&nbsp; Maybe they should toss that tagline and replace it with "80% 
of Photoshop at 20% of the price".&nbsp; </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">What position do we want to 
have?</font>&nbsp; </p>
<p>How do you want the world to think of your product?&nbsp; Identify the three 
parts of a position:&nbsp; superlative, label, and qualifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Superlative ("<em>why</em> choose this product")</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>For what&nbsp;attribute do you want your product to be 
  known?&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually plenty of choices here besides just 
  claiming to "the best" or "the number one".&nbsp; You can choose a superlative 
  which says something more specific.&nbsp; Perhaps you want your product to be 
  known as "the fastest" or "the easiest".&nbsp; For example, Fog Creek appears 
  to be positioning <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/index.html">CityDesk</a> as "the 
  easiest content management tool".</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Label ("<em>what</em> is this product")</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>The important thing here is to choose a position which actually exists in 
  the mind of the people in your target market segment.&nbsp; If you have to 
  invent&nbsp;an entirely new category for your product, then you have chosen a 
  position which doesn't really exist.&nbsp; VA Software <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2003/1102.html">describes</a> 
  their product SourceForge as "the leading Development Intelligence 
  application".&nbsp; I don't think I've ever heard of that category of 
  application before.&nbsp; I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22development+intelligence+application%22+-sourceforge">can't 
  find anybody else</a> that describes their product with that label.&nbsp; As 
  far as I can tell, VA is trying to claim a position which doesn't actually 
  exist.&nbsp; If I had asked you to name the number one Development 
  Intelligence application, what would you have said?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Qualifiers ("<em>who</em> should choose this product")</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>The common mistake here is to avoid using qualifiers, as if their omission 
  will magically increase market share.&nbsp; You need to get specific about who 
  you want to reach with your product.&nbsp; You can describe your market 
  segment by budget, platform, geography, specific feature need, etc.&nbsp; 
  There are lots of qualifiers available.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to use 
them.</p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Is this position already 
occupied?</font></p>
<p>Most of the time, if a position exists, it is occupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
somebody else already holds the position you want, then have two choices:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Evict the competitor
</li>
<li>Find&nbsp;another position
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make this decision<a href="/Choose_Your_Competition.html">carefully</a>.&nbsp; 
It's fun and inspiring to&nbsp;cast a&nbsp;vision with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060516402/sawdust08-20">Big Hairy 
Audacious Goals</a>, but realism can be fun too.&nbsp; For example, if you 
decide your desired position is to be "the&nbsp;number one&nbsp;IDE for Windows 
programmers", I humbly suggest you might consider finding a different 
position.&nbsp; Even with a billion dollars of VC money you probably couldn't 
take this position away from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can win a small position by carving a small chunk out of a 
larger one.&nbsp; You can't beat Visual Studio for the whole Windows developer 
market, but you might be able to beat them for a small, specialized subset of 
those developers.&nbsp; Use more qualifiers.</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">What features should a product in 
this position have?</font></p>
<p>This question brings us back to the point of this article.&nbsp; The reason 
marketing is not a post-processing step is that you have to design your product 
to fit the market position you want it to have.&nbsp; If your product doesn't 
have the features and attributes that are expected, then you probably can't get 
it established in that position.</p>
<p>For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other source control vendors that I 
respect is Perforce.&nbsp; They position their product as "the fast software 
configuration management system".&nbsp; They could not credibly succeed in this 
position unless their product were, er, fast.&nbsp; :-) </p>
<p>SourceGear Vault (our&nbsp;version control product) is positioned to be the 
replacement for Visual SourceSafe.&nbsp; We chose this position from the very 
beginning and we selected features accordingly.&nbsp; People hate switching 
version control tools, so we designed Vault to make the transition as painless 
as possible.&nbsp; We have a SourceSafe import tool.&nbsp; We support every 
feature supported by SourceSafe, usually with the same terminology.&nbsp; 
SourceSafe supports Share, so Vault supports Share.</p>
<p>We describe Vault as a "<a href="http://www.vaultthemovie.com/">compelling 
replacement for Visual SourceSafe</a>".&nbsp; This position would be very hard 
to get if we had not designed and planned for it since the first day.</p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Bottom Line</font></p>
<p>Marketing is not just telling the world about your product.&nbsp; Marketing 
is also deciding what product to build.&nbsp; You have to design and build your 
product to fit the market position you want it to have.</p>
<p>This discussion of positioning is certainly not a complete treatment of the 
topic.&nbsp; If you want to read more, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071373586/sawdust08-20">Positioning: 
The Battle for Your Mind</a>, by Al Ries and Jack Trout.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an 
excellent read and is considered one of the classics of 
marketing.&nbsp;</p>
