title: Ranting about Oreos
---

<P>Making a recent appearance in our kitchen is a package of cookies bearing the 
name "Golden Oreos".&nbsp; Basically, these are Oreo cookies except the cookie 
part is white instead of the usual chocolate.</P>
<P>Which means, quite obviously, that they are <STRONG>not</STRONG> Oreos.&nbsp; 
:-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Oreo is one of the strongest brands in history.&nbsp; Ask a hundred people 
what an Oreo is and 99 of them will tell you it's a <STRONG>chocolate</STRONG> 
sandwich cookie with white creme filling.&nbsp; There have been many successful 
Oreo variations, but all of them were based on the chocolate cookie.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong -- the Golden Oreo is not a bad little cookie.&nbsp; I 
chomped several of them yesterday evening and enjoyed them thoroughly.&nbsp; The 
problem here is not the cookie, but the name.&nbsp; This otherwise innocent 
little cookie is simply <STRONG>not</STRONG> an Oreo.</P>
<P>Golden Oreos are yet another example of a classic marketing mistake called 
"line extension".&nbsp; Basically, this is what happens when somebody&nbsp;with 
a strong brand&nbsp;tries to use that&nbsp;brand to sell something else.&nbsp; 
History shows that this approach is almost always a failure.</P>
<P>This is law #12 in "<A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20">The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</A>" by Al Ries and Jack Trout.</P>
<P>Nabisco should know better.&nbsp; Golden Oreos will soon be forgotten, just 
like A-1 poultry sauce and Life Savers gum.</P>
