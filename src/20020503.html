Congratulations to the <a
href="http://www.abiword.org/">AbiWord</a> team on the advent of their 1.0
releases.<br><br>I started this project four years ago here at SourceGear,
back when we were doing business under the name AbiSource.  Alas, we lost
several hundred thousand dollars before I saw the light and we returned to
focus on low-glamour, profitable stuff like developer tools.  But in the
meantime, a very cool open source word processor was born, and that project
has continued to thrive under the efforts of many volunteers all over the
world.  That team has been working for a very long time to release a stable
1.0-level release which can be used by anyone, and that dream has now
become a reality.  Congratulations!
This has been a good week for those interested in open source office applications.  Previously this week, the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> project released their version 1.0.  This is a reasonably full-featured office suite, based on StarOffice.
So now we are starting to see reasonably credible no-cost alternatives to Microsoft Office.  What effect will this have?  At the least, we would expect Microsoft's profit margins on Office to decline, as basic office suite functionality starts to become a commodity.  But so far, this isn't happening, and I'm not sure it will.  Why is Microsoft able to maintain over 90% market share at extremely high profit margin, when credible no-cost alternatives are available?<br><br>
The popular answer is to accuse Microsoft of monopolistic practices, but this still seems like a knee-jerk reaction.  Why do most of the complaints about the Microsoft monopoly come from software vendors instead of from Microsoft's own customers?  The whole situation smacks of beaten companies using the government to do what they couldn't accomplish any other way.<br><br>The evidence suggests that Microsoft's customers actually prefer to buy their products, even at prices that may be hard to justify using traditional explanations.  Attributing this situation to the monopoly seems like too easy of an answer, as it dismisses the possibility that Microsoft actually might know how to serve its customers better than anybody else.
