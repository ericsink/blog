<P>Obviously I have nowhere near enough time to be a really good blog 
writer.&nbsp; Still, I have stuff to say, and this weblog comes with no 
warranty.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Slashdot recently did a <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=938&amp;section=index&amp;aid=3">poll 
</A>on spam.&nbsp; I'll confess I voted for the "Grey Areas Definitely Exist" 
option.&nbsp; The only reason why is because I don't think we all agree on what 
spam means.</P>
<P>I would agree that unsolicited commercial bulk email is always wrong.&nbsp; 
That's what I call spam.&nbsp; It definitely causes more harm than 
benefit.&nbsp; However, I get frustrated when I see things get labeled as spam 
when I think they're legit.&nbsp; </P>
<P>SourceGear has a mailing list we use to announce new products.&nbsp; It's 
completely opt-in.&nbsp; We send mail to it approximately twice a year.&nbsp; 
And yet, we've had people throw incredible tantrums when they received that 
email.&nbsp; If you didn't want it, then why did you sign up?</P>
<P>Even sillier:&nbsp; I've had people gripe at me for spamming them when I sent 
them an personal hand-written email.&nbsp; Granted, the email was unsolicited, 
but the world of email is severely diminished when we're not allowed to talk to 
someone unless we already know them.</P>
<P>I hate real spam as much as anyone, but anti-spam sentiment can get a little 
out of hand.</P>
