Joel Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020505.html">rants</a>.  He wonders why we need the language choice features offered by .NET.  He explains how he simply chooses the right tool for different kinds of tasks, and seems to assume that everyone else does the same thing.<br><br>
This is a like a naturally thin person who wonders why the world needs exercise equipment and weight loss products.  Joel, I'm glad <b>you</b> have the ability to see end-user objectives so clearly and stay objective about tool choice.  Many developers don't.  Programmers tend to fall in love with a language or tool and then cling to it defensively when anything new comes along.<br><br>
The heated wars over VB vs. C++ are <a href="http://biztech.ericsink.com/religion.html">silliness</a>, but .NET was designed to accomplish its goals by acknowledging that silliness, not by dismissing it.  Microsoft's army of Windows developers is divided -- they're just trying to bring the two sides together.
I think <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/3200101.htm">this article</a> is funny, but there is a serious point to be observed here:  Technology is more easily applied to destruction than construction.  We can level a building far more quickly than we can build one.  We can take a life far more easily than we can save one.<br><br>
Right now, technology is slowly destroying any industry which is based on stuff that can be digitized.  Big changes have happened already:
<ul><li>It's now reasonably easy to ignore the advertisers who pay for the content we enjoy.  <li>It's not too hard to use one of the Napster clones to build up a nice library of our favorite music.
<li>It's not too hard to setup a complete computer system using nothing but no-cost software.
</ul><br><br>
A year or two ago, the popular thing was to make the following, very dangerous assumption:  Because technology is destroying one business, it will provide a new one to take its place.  This just isn't true, and billions of investor dollars went down the drain anyway.  Hopefully we have all learned this lesson.  The invention of the bomb did not automatically bring along technology to remedy its effects.<br><br>
Now the people on these sinking ships are <a href="http://www.inside.com/product/product.asp?entity=CableWorld&pf_ID=7A2ACA71-FAAD-41FC-A100-0B8A11C30373">panicking</a>.  When they said Napster users were lawbreakers, I agreed, but their latest desperation claim is preposterous.<br><br>
I am not reveling in the destruction that seems to be taking place here.  Sure, I'd rather see my TV shows without commercials, but right now those ads are part of the complex system which brings content into my family room.  (Many of today's commercials are better than today's shows anyway.)  But the people who are pleased to watch (and help effect) the demise of these industries are probably making too many assumptions about what's next.  The next thing may be better, or it may not.
