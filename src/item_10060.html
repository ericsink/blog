I suppose the big technology news of the week is the Fed decision to give up on the breakup of Microsoft.  This doesn't seem like really big news to me.  The breakup was not going to happen anyway, and even if it did, I don't think it would have accomplished what independent software vendors really want.<br><br>I still can't say that I fully understand the underlying principles of antitrust law.  On the basis of what foundational principles should the government interfere with a monopoly?  Obviously, Microsoft is a monopoly, and obviously that creates problems for those of us who are not Microsoft.  We may not <b>like</b> living under the shadow of a monopoly, but that doesn't explain to me why we should interfere with something which arguably formed in a natural manner.  I guess I'm too much of a Republican.  Big governments bother me a <b>lot</b> more than big companies.
