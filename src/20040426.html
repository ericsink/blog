<P>I recently read <A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214327X/sawdust08-20">Coder to 
Developer</A>, by Mike Gunderloy.&nbsp; Very good book.</P>
<P>Mike covers an assortment of topics, all of which are important to software 
development:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Choosing features 
  <LI>Architecture 
  <LI>Using source control 
  <LI>Using exceptions and assertions 
  <LI>Using an IDE 
  <LI>Examining source code 
  <LI>Code generation tools 
  <LI>Bug-tracking 
  <LI>Logging 
  <LI>Working on small teams 
  <LI>Documentation 
  <LI>Builds 
  <LI>Licensing 
  <LI>Installers</LI></UL>
<P>This is the stuff which is typically not taught.&nbsp; This is the stuff 
which people fresh out of college don't know, and everybody expects them to just 
learn it as they go.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;stuff which distinguishes true <A 
href="No_Programmers.html">developers</A> from mere 
programmers.</P>
<P>This book mentions a lot of specific technologies and tools, and it's very 
current right now.&nbsp; However, I plan to be fussing at Mike every&nbsp;two 
years for an updated edition.&nbsp; Ten years from now, these important topics 
will still be the difference between coders and developers.</P>
<P>Gunderloy is a fine writer, and the book is enjoyable to read.&nbsp; There's 
an excellent&nbsp;foreword from <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel 
Spolsky</A> as well.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I highly recommend <A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214327X/sawdust08-20">Coder to 
Developer</A> for all programmers, especially those working in a small ISV.</P>
<P><EM>Disclosure:&nbsp; Mike Gunderloy is a fan of SourceGear Vault, and this 
is evident in the book.&nbsp; The truth is that I would recommend this book even 
if all mention of SourceGear were removed.&nbsp; However, I think it is 
appropriate to disclose the facts.</EM></P>
