<P><STRONG>What is CornSharp?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>CornSharp is a tool for editing and publishing a weblog.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>What are its key features?</STRONG></P>
<UL dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <UL>
    <LI>Works with any web server.&nbsp; CornSharp generates static HTML files 
    and requires no dynamic content generation on the web server. 
    <LI>Written entirely in C#. 
    <LI>RSS 2.0 support. 
    <LI>Date-oriented index of all items. 
    <LI>Supports regular weblog items as well as "Feature" items.</LI></UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>Isn't that terribly inefficient, copying all those files up to the 
server every time something changes?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>CornSharp only uploads the files that have changed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Can&nbsp;it publish with passive FTP?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Yes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Can&nbsp;it publish with active FTP?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>No.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Can&nbsp;it publish with SSH?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Not any more.&nbsp; This feature was originally present, but it used a 
  proprietary component, so I removed the feature when I released the source 
  code.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Why is it called "CornSharp"?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Primarily, because nothing <EM>else</EM> is called CornSharp.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">
</P>
  <P>Seriously, I didn't put a great deal of thought into the name.&nbsp; I 
  included "Sharp" because several other .NET-centric freebie applications have 
  that word in the name.&nbsp; The word "Corn" is included because I live in 
  Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, which is essentially in the middle of a giant 
  cornfield.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Isn't "CornSharp" the dumbest name ever?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Yeah, I thought "eBay" was a dumb name when I first heard it.&nbsp; 
  Just wait until CornSharp achieves its goal of total world domination -- the 
  name won't sound quite so dumb then.<img src="smiley.gif"></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Why is the version number 0.5?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Calling it version 1.0 would have been audacious.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Does CornSharp have themes or skins so I can completely change the 
way my weblog looks?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Sorry, no.&nbsp; CornSharp offers you a limited amount of control over the 
  appearance of your weblog, but the general layout cannot currently be 
  changed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Aren't you&nbsp;with&nbsp;SourceGear?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Yep.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Is this a SourceGear product?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Definitely not.&nbsp; SourceGear sells version control tools.&nbsp; We have 
  no plans to get into the market for blogging tools.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Can I call SourceGear for support?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Please don't.&nbsp; They had nothing to do with this.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Why did you write CornSharp?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>For the fun of it.&nbsp; I use lots of software from various sources, but I 
  also like using software that I wrote for myself.&nbsp; Some people call it 
  "Not Invented Here" syndrome, but I think of it as craftsmanship.&nbsp; I'm a 
  programmer, so I wrote my own blog tool.&nbsp; I'm also a woodworker, so I 
  built my own desk.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Will you add a new feature if I ask for it?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Probably not.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> Seriously, you can ask, but I'm not making 
  any promises.&nbsp; Writing CornSharp is a spare time activity for me.&nbsp; 
  My day job keeps me plenty busy too.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Will you fix bugs in CornSharp?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Maybe.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Can I call you on the phone for tech support on 
CornSharp?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Nope.&nbsp; This software comes with No Warranty, No Support, and No 
  Promises.<img src="smiley.gif"></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>Can I email you about 
CornSharp?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Sure.&nbsp; My email address is <A 
  href="mailto:eric@sourcegear.com">eric@sourcegear.com</A>.&nbsp; I try to 
  answer all my email, but sometimes things slip through the cracks when I get 
  really swamped.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Why does CornSharp generate static HTML files?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Because I wanted a tool which can work with <EM>any</EM> web server.&nbsp; 
  My personal web server is a Linux box.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Your webserver is running on Linux?&nbsp; Is something wrong with 
you?&nbsp; Don't you like ASP.NET?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Guilty, I suppose.&nbsp; I'm a .NET-fanatic, and ASP.NET is very cool, but 
  I've been&nbsp;running my personal server on Debian Linux for years and 
  I&nbsp;just can't bring myself to switch it over to Windows.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>How did you implement the FTP feature?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>I used some <A 
  href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ftplibrary.asp?target=ftpclient">code</A> 
  I found on CodeProject.com, written by somebody named Dan Glass.&nbsp; I've 
  made no changes to this code, and it seems to work fine.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>How did you implement the WYSIWYG HTML editor?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>I started with code I found <A 
  href="http://www.itwriting.com/htmleditor/index.php">here</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>What's wrong with all the other blogging tools?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Nothing.&nbsp; I've used Radio, and it seems okay.&nbsp; I've never tried 
  MovableType.&nbsp; I like <A 
  href="http://scottwater.com/blog/default.aspx">.Text</A>, but I wanted a 
  client-side-only alternative.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Why isn't the output XHTML-compliant?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Sorry, I just haven't gotten around to fixing this yet.&nbsp; It may be 
  difficult to fix, since the WYSIWYG editor generates lame HTML.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>What does the Sidebar button do?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>The Sidebar button brings up an HTML editor.&nbsp; Anything you type here 
  will be included in the left sidebar of every page on your weblog 
site.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Will CornSharp manage my BlogRoll?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>There is no special support for managing a blogroll, but you can use the 
  Sidebar feature to include anything you like.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>I want my weblog to have a form where users can send me email.&nbsp; 
Can CornSharp do this?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>No.&nbsp; This would require CGI or ASP or something like that.&nbsp; 
  CornSharp weblogs are pure static HTML, nothing more.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Can my weblog have a discussion board where people can post 
comments?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>No.&nbsp; This would require CGI or ASP or something like 
  that.&nbsp; CornSharp weblogs are pure static HTML, nothing 
more.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Does CornSharp work with </STRONG><A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/vbtchNo-TouchDeploymentInNETFramework.asp"><STRONG>No-Touch 
Deployment</STRONG></A><STRONG>?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>No.&nbsp; Currently CornSharp expects to be installed on your 
  desktop system and store your weblog data files there.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>What if I want to blog from two different 
machines?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Right now CornSharp doesn't work well under that scenario.&nbsp; I 
  suggest using a server-based solution.&nbsp; I hope to update CornSharp to 
  work well with No-Touch Deployment in a future release.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>How is my weblog data stored?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>All your weblog items are stored in a single XML file.&nbsp; 
  Attachments and images are stored separately.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Are you planning to charge money for CornSharp in the 
future?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Nope.&nbsp; I already have a <A 
  href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">job</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Can't CornSharp remember my blog file so I don't have to 
"Open Weblog" every time I run the app?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>I don't have an MRU list, but there is a simple workaround.&nbsp; 
  The CornSharp executable is called CornGUI.exe and it will accept a command 
  line argument which specifies the weblog XML file to be opened.&nbsp; Create a 
  shortcut on your desktop which includes the argument and then use that 
  shortcut to open CornSharp.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Can CornSharp integrate with any version control system so I 
can keep track of the revision history of my blog data?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Not yet.&nbsp; If I ever add this feature, you can probably guess 
  which <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">version control tool</A> I 
  plan to support first.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Are you going to build an aggregator into CornSharp in a 
future release?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Probably not.&nbsp; I use NewsGator and I like it just fine.&nbsp; 
  I've used SharpReader too and liked it as well.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Any plans to put a spell checker into the built-in HTML 
editor?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Probably not.&nbsp; I'll admit that I wish it had one.&nbsp; I find 
  that I use it more than I thought I would.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>Are you going to make CornSharp support the Blogger 
API?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>Probably not.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><STRONG>How can I get CornSharp?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P dir=ltr>The source code is hosted on <A
