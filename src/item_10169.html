<p>Most people in blogspace already know that today Microsoft announced a full 
suite of lifecycle development tools called the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/default.aspx">Visual Studio 
Team System</a>.&nbsp; One piece of this system is a new enterprise-class source 
control system which is code-named "Hatteras".&nbsp; These announcements are 
causing&nbsp;lots of people&nbsp;to ask&nbsp;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/korbyp/archive/2004/05/24/140550.aspx">questions</a> 
about SourceGear Vault.&nbsp; This blog posting is intended to start answering 
those questions.&nbsp; We appreciate Microsoft for putting us under NDA and 
sharing the news about Hatteras in advance.&nbsp; We've known about&nbsp;this 
for over nine months, and&nbsp;we are glad to finally be able to 
publicly&nbsp;talk about what this news means for SourceGear and Vault.</p>
<p><strong>Is Hatteras based on technology from Vault?</strong></p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Just like Vault, Hatteras is built on SQL Server as the underlying 
repository store.&nbsp; Because of this, I have already&nbsp;heard a number of 
people asking if perhaps Microsoft might have licensed&nbsp;some technology from 
SourceGear.&nbsp; Alas, this is not the case.&nbsp; Microsoft's new 
enterprise-class source control tool was written from scratch by a team in the 
Raleigh-Durham area.&nbsp; The team is being led&nbsp; by Brian Harry, the guy 
who originally developed SourceSafe at OneTree before it was acquired by 
Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Does this mean&nbsp;SourceGear Vault is dead?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We certainly don't think so.&nbsp; Obviously we do not consider this to be 
<em>good</em> news.&nbsp; Over time, every source control vendor will be 
impacted by Microsoft's decision to finally take source control seriously.&nbsp; 
We would all certainly prefer that Microsoft stay out of this market 
segment.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we don't get everything we want.</p>
<p>Hatteras is not the end of SourceGear Vault.&nbsp; There is plenty of room 
for SourceGear and other vendors to differentiate and continue to have a healthy 
market.</p>
<p><strong>Different Positioning</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="/Positioning.html">positioning</a> 
of Hatteras is simply different from Vault.&nbsp; Hatteras appears to be 
designed to kill Rational ClearCase, not Vault.&nbsp; In fact, it seems clear to 
me that the entire new suite of lifecycle tools is Microsoft's reaction to IBM's 
acquisition of Rational.&nbsp; I admit that SourceGear will be impacted, but the 
damage is basically incidental.&nbsp; If you think Microsoft is out to beat 
SourceGear, you don't understand Microsoft.&nbsp; We are quite successful for a 
small company, but we are not even close to being on Microsoft's radar 
screen.&nbsp; Microsoft is firing its weapons at Rational, and SourceGear is 
simply a little too close to the battlefield to remain completely unharmed.</p>
<p>Most of the damage will happen in terms of very large customers.&nbsp; I'm 
talking about teams with several hundred developers or more.&nbsp; Those kinds 
of companies aren't really looking seriously at Vault anyway.&nbsp; Vault is 
currently selling&nbsp;very well with teams of 10, 25 and 50 developers.&nbsp; 
We don't see that changing anytime soon.&nbsp; That kind of small team doesn't 
need the sheer size of something like ClearCase or Hatteras.</p>
<p>And they probably can't afford it either.&nbsp; Pricing for Hatteras has not 
yet been announced, but folks are getting the impression that it will be very 
expensive.&nbsp; I don't think this tool is going to be "basically free" like 
SourceSafe.&nbsp; If you're thinking about Hatteras, you should probably look at 
the pricing for ClearCase and assume it may end up in a similar ballpark.</p>
<p><strong>Different Features</strong></p>
<p>The source control market has always been highly fragmented.&nbsp; No player 
dominates this arena, and Hatteras is not going to change that.&nbsp; If you can 
afford it, Hatteras will eventually be the preferred tool for teams which 
develop only on Windows using only Visual Studio.&nbsp; But despite all of 
Microsoft's efforts, there are plenty of teams which don't fit neatly inside 
that box.</p>
<p>Do&nbsp;you need clients on Unix or MacOS?&nbsp; Do you want integration with 
other development environments besides Visual Studio?&nbsp; Do you have a 
limited budget?&nbsp; Microsoft is not likely to meet these needs, and that will 
leave opportunities open for other vendors.&nbsp; Granted, these are niche 
opportunities.&nbsp; I'm not saying that the source control market will spawn a 
bunch of high-flying IPOs.&nbsp; I am merely pointing out just a couple of 
examples why there will be plenty of vendors who continue to exist and thrive in 
this space.&nbsp; Unless we screw something up badly, SourceGear will be one of 
them.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
<p>SourceGear has been in business for over seven years.&nbsp; We have learned 
how to put plywood over our windows when the storm is approaching.&nbsp; This 
storm will not be fatal for us.</p>
<p>Microsoft was kind enough to give us nine months advance notice before 
today's announcement.&nbsp; We probably have at least another nine months before 
Hatteras 1.0 is shipping.&nbsp; Vault 2.0 is available now.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's 
selling extremely well and our customers love it.&nbsp; We plan to stay focused 
on our product and our customers.&nbsp; Our plans did not change today.</p>
<p>Still, Hatteras has probably ruined my chances of becoming a billionaire by 
age 40.&nbsp; I definitely blame Brian Harry for that.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif" /> </p>
<p>But SourceGear and Vault are going to be okay.</p>
