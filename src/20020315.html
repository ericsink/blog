<P>In my day job I am a software developer at <A

tools for Windows developers:

  <LI><A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite</A> is a

<P>In October 2002, SourceGear was named one of the <A 
href="http://www.inc.com/inc500/">fastest growing</A> companies in the nation by 
Inc magazine. 
<P>By my original training, I am a software programmer. I have a B.S. in 
Computer Science from the <A href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois 
</A>at Urbana-Champaign. I founded the <A 
href="http://www.abisource.org/">AbiWord</A> project and was responsible for 
much of the original design and implementation. 
<P>Prior to founding SourceGear, I was at Spyglass (now OpenTV) for around five 
years. I served there as Project Lead for the browser team. We built the 
original versions of the browser you now know as "Internet Explorer".</P>
