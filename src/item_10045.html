<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/fog0000000337.html">Joel:</a>"This means that almost everything we do as software developers is something that has never been done before."  Sorry Joel, I don't think your comparison works out very well.  Herman the Handyman doesn't reinvent the tile itself for every job.<br><br>
I think we have to face reality here.  People who want software construction to be as predictable as building construction are never going to be satisfied.<br><br>Yes, we should admit that sometimes the problem is that the developers are unprofessional.<br><br>Sometimes the problem is the sheer rate of change in the technology around us.  People who build houses don't have to check the news every morning to see if somebody made their entire approach obsolete.<br><br>Some claim that software development is a mix of engineering and art.  If so, has any industry every tried as hard as we have to make creativity structured, critical and predictable?  Sure, you can ask a novelist or sculptor to meet a deadline, but nobody is trying to run their business on the book or the statue.
