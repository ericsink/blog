teaser: For any team of two or more people, I can credibly argue the benefits of a good source control tool. And as the team gets even larger, source control evolves from "beneficial" to "compelling" to "necessary" and finally to "you are a complete bozo if you don't use it".

<p>Many people have asked us for a single-user SourceGear Vault license at a 
very-low-cost.&nbsp; We've always thought this was a good idea, but we never got 
around to implementing it until today.&nbsp; The Single User Edition of 
Vault&nbsp;is <a href="https://store.sourcegear.com/Sales/catalog.asp">now 
available</a>&nbsp;at a cost of $49.</p>
<p>It's amazing the speed at which things move in 2003.&nbsp; This afternoon we 
made the necessary entries in our online store, so the product was available for 
purchase at that time, even though our company website had not been 
appropriately updated yet.&nbsp; Within about an hour, somebody noticed the new 
item in our store's catalog and&nbsp;posted a <a href="http://lists.sourcegear.com/pipermail/vault-list/2003-November/002118.html">note</a> 
to the Vault mailing list.&nbsp; Marc LaFleur caught that note and proceeded to 
write a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mlafleur/posts/35581.aspx">blog 
entry</a>.&nbsp; Long story short, about 8 hours after its availability, I'm 
finally blogging about the Single User Edition&nbsp;now, and it's already old 
news.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif" /> </p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jlerman/">Julia Lerman</a> suggested that I 
might write a brief explanation of why anyone would want to use source control 
alone anyway.&nbsp; She raises a good point -- source control is usually 
explained as a way of keeping developers from stepping on each others' 
toes.&nbsp; Why would anyone want to use source control on&nbsp;a team of 
one?</p>
<p>The first answer is simply to admit that for a solo developer, source control 
actually isn't all that compelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were, we could charge a 
heckuva lot more than&nbsp;49 bucks for it.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any team of two or more people, I&nbsp;can credibly argue the benefits of 
a good source control tool.&nbsp; And as the team&nbsp;gets even 
larger,&nbsp;source control evolves from "beneficial" to "compelling" to 
"necessary" and finally to "you are a complete bozo if you don't use it".</p>
<p>But with just one lonely coder (we <em>almost</em> called this product the 
"Lonely Coder Edition"), the benefits of source control are a bit less 
important.&nbsp; Nonetheless, lots of people do use a source control tool when 
working alone.&nbsp; I'm sure this is partially because it's tough to get out of 
the habit once you've made source control a part of your normal workflow.&nbsp; 
But when I use a source control tool all by myself, here are the benefits that I 
find still apply:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p><strong>It's an undo mechanism</strong>.&nbsp; Whenever I get to a good 
  stopping point in my code, I checkin my changes to the repository.&nbsp; From 
  that point on, I can be less careful.&nbsp; I can try coding some crazy new 
  idea and when it doesn't work, I just revert my working folder to my last 
  checkin point.</p>
  <p><strong>It's a historical archive</strong>.&nbsp; Sometimes I want to Undo 
  much further back.&nbsp; My repository history contains a full copy of every 
  version I have ever checked in.&nbsp; If I ever need to go back and find 
  something I once had, it's there.</p>
  <p><strong>It's a reference point for diff</strong>.&nbsp; A source control 
  tool can easily show a diff of all the changes I've made since my last 
  checkin.</p>
  <p><strong>It's a backup</strong>.&nbsp; When I regularly checkin my work, I 
  always know that there are two copies of it.&nbsp; If my *&amp;^%#@! laptop 
  hard drive <a href="20030927.html#10124">dies</a> 
  again, my code is still safe in the repository.</p>
  <p><strong>It's a journal of my progress</strong>.&nbsp; When I do my regular 
  checkins, I write a comment explaining what I was doing.&nbsp; These comments 
  serve as a log or a journal, explaining the motivation&nbsp;behind every 
  change I have ever made.</p>
  <p><strong>It's a server</strong>.&nbsp; Sometimes I'm coding on different 
  computers.&nbsp; The repository becomes my central server.&nbsp; I can go 
  anywhere I want and I can still get to my code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some will observe that all of these benefits are available through other 
means.&nbsp; That's true.&nbsp; Like I said, source control for a single user 
isn't truly compelling for most people.&nbsp; Speaking just for myself, I use 
source control because I <em>like</em> it, and I thought folks might be 
interested in hearing why.</p>
