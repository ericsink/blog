title: Time to try OpenOffice.org?
---

<P>I haven't even read <A 
href="http://members.microsoft.com/partner/salesmarketing/opensource/discguides/OpenOffice.pdf">this</A>, 
(link discovered on <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/03/25/1950234.shtml">Slashdot</A>) but I 
don't need to.&nbsp; When Microsoft publishes a comparison like this, they 
validate their competitor.&nbsp; OpenOffice.org has never really interested me 
very much, until now.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"></P>
