<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #20:  The Law of Hype</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">28 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Hype talks about the fact that "history is filled with marketing 
failures that were successful in the press".</P>
<P>This chapter talks primarily about&nbsp;new things&nbsp;which claim to make 
existing&nbsp;things obsolete.&nbsp; Such products tend to become darlings in 
the press, because the notion of breakthru innovation is very attractive to 
readers.&nbsp; People love to read stories about things like&nbsp;the personal 
helicopter, which&nbsp;was&nbsp;supposed&nbsp;to make cars obsolete several 
decades ago.&nbsp; So the press jumps on the bandwagon, stories get written, 
newspapers get sold, and people get excited.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;they still 
drive their cars to work everyday.</P>
<P>What I love about this chapter is that it was written in the early nineties, 
before the Web, and it still rings amazingly true.&nbsp; The Web was supposed to 
obsolete almost everything.&nbsp; Today we can see that the Web has changed life 
in many ways, but most of the&nbsp;previous structures and systems are still 
with us.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are lots of examples in the chapter, all of them prior to 1994.&nbsp; 
Polyester did not obsolete wool.&nbsp; The videophone has now been getting press 
for 40 years, but most people still use a plain-old audio phone.&nbsp; Compare 
those examples to the overhyped things of the last ten years.&nbsp; Webvan came, 
and I still shop at a grocery store.&nbsp; The Segway came, and I still drive my 
car.&nbsp; Amazon came, and I still go to the Borders store near my home.&nbsp; 
The truth is that fundamental change doesn't occur so easily.&nbsp; Even when 
the innovation is quite real, people&nbsp;are not quick to give up existing 
mainstream products and services.</P>
<P>The chapter doesn't mention this, but I think the venture capital industry 
deserves as much blame for excess hype as the press.&nbsp; Perhaps even more 
than magazine readers, VCs love the idea of a product which obsoletes existing 
mainstream products.&nbsp; They need high-risk/high-reward investments.&nbsp; 
Convincing a VC that your product will make cars obsolete is a great way to get 
funded.&nbsp; If we are upset about the level of hype in our world (and I'm not 
saying that we are), the press and the VCs are equally guilty.</P>
<P>The vast majority of&nbsp;companies thrive and make&nbsp;a profit in a world 
which is completely disjoint from the one where the VCs and the press 
live.&nbsp; They don't spend their time convincing investors and reporters that 
their product will change the world.&nbsp; Instead, they spend their time 
convincing customers that their product is a good purchase.&nbsp; It's very 
difficult to do both -- that's why the companies you see on the front page are 
often dead within a few years, while the companies making real money are the 
ones you hardly ever hear about.</P>
<P>It's a choice between fame and fortune.&nbsp; Rare is the product which 
achieves both.&nbsp; So, the important thing here is for entrepreneurs to see 
both paths clearly and make a conscious choice.&nbsp; For small ISVs, it is 
inconceivable to me that the path of hype is the wise choice.&nbsp; Find 
something boring and profitable.</P>
