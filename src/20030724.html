<P>Obviously my accomplishments don't&nbsp;measure up&nbsp;to guys like <A 
href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sells</A>.&nbsp; But if I work hard, 
perhaps&nbsp;someday&nbsp;I too can be a <A 
href="http://www.softwarelegends.com/">Software Legend</A>, right?</P>
<P>Aw, nevermind, that's probably not realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;<A 
href="http://notalegend.com/">NotALegend.com</A> will have to suffice.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">

<P>Even though Iowa is adjacent to Illinois, for my entire life I have managed 
to avoid visiting the so-called Hawkeye State.&nbsp; Unbelievable as it may 
seem, not only am I headed over there this afternoon, but I am going for a <A 
href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">conference</A>!</P>
<P>Then again, I suppose only work could bring me to Iowa, since it seems even 
more unlikely that I would go there as a tourist.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>I see <A

Wilson</A> and <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rholloway/posts/10489.aspx">Randy 
Holloway</A> are going, so it looks like I'll have a chance to meet some 
bloggers in person, including of course the <A 
href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">man in charge</A>.&nbsp; Should be a fun 
event.</P>
