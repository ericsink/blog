<P>With gratitude and a sheepish grin, I&nbsp;take this&nbsp;opportunity to 
mention&nbsp;that SourceGear won a <A 
href="http://www.ftponline.com/reports/vslivesf/2004/awards/">Readers Choice 
Award</A> at the recent VSLive show.</P>
<P>I wear the sheepish grin for several reasons.&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
  <LI>First of all, I had no idea we were nominated.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Second, I have no idea who the competition was.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Third, we won in a category which seems to be an odd fit for our 
  products.</LI></UL>
<P>But the gratitude remains.&nbsp; These awards are good-old-fashioned 
popularity contests, and we won.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;always nice to be 
liked.</P>
