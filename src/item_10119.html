<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Dissonance</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">08 Aug 2003</span></p>
<P>You wanna know what's weird about being a small ISV?&nbsp; Glad you 
asked.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Two days ago&nbsp;I got the following email from a customer:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><EM>Please pass along my compliments to your development team. In less than 
  15 minutes I had installed and uploaded my first project to the vault with 
  ZERO problems. Coming from the source safe world thats unheard of. Awesome 
  job.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Obviously we like these notes, and we're happy that most of our customers 
have this kind of experience with our product.</P>
<P>And then yesterday I got another email from a different 
customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The message&nbsp;started out like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><EM>We have just spent several days trying to migrate our VSS repository to 
  Vault with almost no success.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When a customer has problems with our product, we drop everything to help 
them.&nbsp; We want to do whatever it takes to make sure they're happy.&nbsp; 
But the nagging questions still ring in my mind:&nbsp; How can both of these 
emails be true?&nbsp; Is the product great?&nbsp; Or is it lame?&nbsp; Surely it 
can't be both?</P>
<P>I've been selling dev tools for quite a while now, and I've had to learn that 
sometimes life is like this.&nbsp; One customer has no trouble, and another has 
nothing but.&nbsp; The reasons are rarely obvious.&nbsp; All you can do is be 
thankful that happy customers are the majority, and then get to work figuring 
out what's wrong.</P>
<P>Granted, this kind of thing happens more often with younger products like 
Vault.&nbsp; But strangely enough, it&nbsp;still happens&nbsp;sometimes with 
SourceOffSite.&nbsp; This product is quite mature and is being used by over 
50,000 people.&nbsp; And yet, every few months we hear from a customer who just 
can't make the product work at all.&nbsp; Weird.</P>
<P>I could write a long&nbsp;article on why this happens, but sometimes it's 
nice to not be a "know-it-all".&nbsp; If you're running a small ISV, next time 
this kind of dissonance happens to you, drop me an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll 
commiserate.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
