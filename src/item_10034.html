Don Box caused quite a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/26/1712236&mode=thread&tid=95">stir</a> with his <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-845220.html">remarks</a> about HTTP.  I'd say his point is valid, even if he may have used exaggeration for emphasis.  We use HTTP in ways that probably are not in complete alignment with its original design goals.  That's usually a sign of a good technology -- it becomes so widely used that it gets stretched a bit.
