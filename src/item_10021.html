After reading my site, someone sent me email asking me to explain the actual differences between a "software developer" and a "software programmer".<br><br>
I don't think you'll find any strict definitions for these terms which are consisently used across the industry.  I have my own definitions which I use here at SourceGear to help align our teams with my particular philosophy of software development.<br><br>
The background principle is that shipping a software product requires a LOT more than just programming.  I often use the term "software development" generically to refer to all the activities necessary to get a product shipped.  This includes choosing the feature set, designing the architecture, writing the code, drawing the toolbar art, writing the documentation, coding the installer, making sure the daily builds are working, writing the test plans, testing the features, communicating with each other, and a whole bunch of other activities.<br><br>
We're a small company, so we don't have the luxury of strict specialization.  Most of us do more than one thing.  In companies our size, it is important to have a "whatever it takes" kind of attitude.  Ultimately our job is to do whatever it takes to get our products shipped.  In that sense, we are all "software developers".<br><br>
The word "programmer" has a narrower meaning, so I don't use it as much.<br><br>
Actually the term I use most is "Software Craftsman".  That's the title on my business card.<br><br>
Note that this is <b>my</b> philosophy, and lots of people use these terms in very different ways.  For example, in a BigCo, it's more important to create tight boundaries around everyone to prevent them from stepping on each others' toes.  The result is that they often have trouble finding job titles which are sufficiently narrow and specific.  I prefer smaller environments which give each individual greater flexibility to add value in accordance with all of his/her talents.  Both approaches result in their own flavor and degree of chaos.  Business is little more than proactively choosing which sets of problems you prefer.
