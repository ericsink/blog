title: SourceGear Vault Review in Visual Studio Magazine
---

<P><A 
href="http://www.fawcette.com/vsm/2003_06/magazine/departments/firstlooks/">Don 
Kiely</A>: "Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) has long been a widely used source 
code control product, but many developers love to hate it. Take heart: 
SourceGear has released SourceGear Vault, a modestly priced replacement for 
VSS."</P>
