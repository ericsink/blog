I wrote my first C# program today!  Actually, I wrote two.  Don't be too impressed.  Both were just variations on Hello World, one console, one GUI.<br><br>Visual Studio.NET is very VB-ish, which I suppose is not bad.  I'm still an emacs fan.  BTW, in the world of .NET, "<tt>printf</tt>" is spelled "<tt>System.Console.WriteString</tt>".<br>  <i>Don't knock it 'til you've tried it.</i>
Great Bridge went <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-09-06-014-20-PR-BZ">out of business</a> today.  Bummer.  PostgreSQL is cool.  Open Source stuff is definitely aimed at a real problem.  When comparing free stuff against leading enterprise products, the gap between price seems way out of proportion to the gap between features.  Some of these markets will eventually move toward commodity pricing.  Ultra-high profit margins cannot continue indefinitely in a world where all the leading databases, word processors and spreadsheets have comparable feature sets.  In the meantime, Open Source business models just don't work well.  Intellectual property protection is still a big ingredient that makes software recipes work.
