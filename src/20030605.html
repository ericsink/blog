<P>I like almost everything about Joel's latest article, <A 
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/VC.html">Fixing Venture 
Capital</A>.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>I like his discussion of the&nbsp;different risk/reward 
  preferences&nbsp;between founders and VCs. 
  <LI>I like his hockey-stick graphs of company growth, even though most small 
  ISVs would be delighted if the curve could simply be linear. 
  <LI>I like his discussion of what happens to a company when things get out of 
  balance. 
  <LI>I like the way his article characterizes all VCs as ogres, even though not 
  all of them are really that bad. 
  <LI>I like the fact that what he's actually doing is setting the bar 
  <EM>really</EM> high for the day when he does decide to get a VC involved in 
  Fog Creek.</LI></UL>
<P>The only thing I don't like about this article is the title.&nbsp; Calling it 
"Fixing Venture Capital" gives the impression that the VC industry can be 
fixed.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Seriously, if&nbsp;I were to paraphrase&nbsp;Joel's article down to three 
simple imperatives for the VC industry, it looks like this:</P>
<OL dir=ltr>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Tune your risk/reward expectations to be more 
  closely fit the goals of the entrepreneurs.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Instead of bonging 99.9% of firms that solicit 
  you for money, go out and find the good ones that are too busy selling 
  products to sell stock.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Realize that by screwing the founders you are 
  simply excluding the smartest founders from your deal flow.&nbsp; Cut it 
  out.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>Obviously if more of the VC world worked this way, it would become a heckuva 
lot more appealing to founders.&nbsp; However, we have to remember that the 
venture capitalist is a middleman, with founders downline and limited partners 
upline.&nbsp; Just like the entrepreneur, the VC has to keep things in 
balance.&nbsp; Making founders happier is great, but if doing so makes the 
limiteds unhappy, the whole thing will fall apart.</P>
<P>Let's distill Joel's piece down even further to make one single piece of 
advice for how the VC world should change:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>If you would become a lot more patient about liquidity, you could attract 
  much&nbsp;better portfolio companies.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And therein lies the problem.&nbsp; Asking a VC to be more patient means he 
in turn will have to ask his limited partners upline to be more patient.&nbsp; 
The limiteds don't want to do this.&nbsp; They've got $100M to invest and 
they're trying to decide which of two VC firms will manage it for them.&nbsp; 
One of those firms is asking for patience.&nbsp; The other is singing a catchy 
tune about finding The Next Netscape.&nbsp; Which firm gets the bucks?</P>
<P>Bottom line:&nbsp; Joel correctly observes that&nbsp;most VC&nbsp;firms don't 
have much to offer people who want to build solid, long-lived companies.&nbsp; 
Don't expect this situation to change anytime soon.</P>
