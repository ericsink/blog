<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #15:  The Law of Candor</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">21 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Candor says that "when you admit a negative, the prospect will 
give you a positive".&nbsp; As usual, the examples from the book are mainstream 
consumer products:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Listerine did it when they acknowledged that their mouthwash tastes 
  terrible. 
  <LI>Avis did it when they acknowledged that they are #2. 
  <LI>Volkswagen did it when they acknowledged that the "bug" is ugly.</LI></UL>
<P>Each of these companies gained a lot when they applied the Law of 
Candor.&nbsp; People respect the courage and honesty it takes to admit that not 
everything is perfect.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Being Genuine</FONT></P>
<P>The Law of Candor is another one which is simply not intuitive.&nbsp; Most 
marcomm people are terrified of it.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom says that 
absolutely everything in your marketing message must be positive.&nbsp; In 
fact,&nbsp;a primary function of the marcomm team is to sanitize all public 
statements, ensuring that the company never says anything it does not want to 
say.</P>
<P>The rules of "marketing speak" are fairly well understood around the 
world.&nbsp; All marcomm teams speak this dialect as their first language, which 
means that all marketing teams sound basically the same.&nbsp; Almost every 
press release starts out with a bunch of mumbo jumbo that nobody ever 
reads:&nbsp; "Fiddlesticks Corporation, the leading provider of useless crapola, 
announced today that it&nbsp;is incorporating XML Web Services technology into 
its line of coffee mugs."&nbsp; </P>
<P>In 2004, it takes a very "special" kind of marketing person to actually 
believe that customers cannot see through this kind of spin.&nbsp; People today 
are being bombarded with so much advertising that traditional marketing is less 
effective than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanitized press releases are out.&nbsp; 
<A 
href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/20.html#a7831">Transparency</A> 
is in.&nbsp; Drowning in a sea of marketing mumbo jumbo, people admire companies 
that choose to be genuine.</P>
<P>An example from here at SourceGear:&nbsp; Most of our sales are "direct", but 
we do sell through a number of resellers as well.&nbsp; I don't usually think of 
our resellers as terribly strategic, since they account for a very small 
percentage of our sales.&nbsp; However, lately I find myself wondering why 
SourceGear doesn't sell through <A 
href="http://www.xtras.net/">Xtras.net</A>.&nbsp; Why am I wondering this?&nbsp; 
Because their CEO has a <A 
href="http://blogs.xtras.net/mikes/PermaLink,guid,daa1e487-18b5-4080-8141-536f600b0ab7.aspx">blog</A>, 
and a darn good one.&nbsp; I can't say that I agree with everything he says, but 
the fact remains:&nbsp; His choice to be genuine makes me <EM>want</EM> to do 
business with his company.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Credibility</FONT></P>
<P>Ignoring&nbsp;the Law of Candor can kill your credibility.&nbsp; Whatever 
your negative issue is, everybody already knows about it anyway.&nbsp; If you 
don't talk about it, then it will become "the elephant in the room".&nbsp; When 
you issue yet another sanitized press release, your customers eagerly read it, 
hoping to see some evidence that you have any self-awareness at all.&nbsp; They 
ask themselves, "Don't these people realize how awful their mouthwash 
tastes?"</P>
<P>As Ries and Trout say in the chapter, "Every negative statement you make 
about yourself is instantly accepted as truth.&nbsp; Positive statements, on the 
other hand, are looked at as dubious at best."</P>
<P>These dynamics are going on right now for me with respect to SourceGear 
Vault, our&nbsp;source control product.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, Microsoft 
announced Team Foundation Server, a really cool source control system which will 
be shipping sometime next year.&nbsp; It's not too hard to figure out that this 
announcement was not good news for SourceGear.</P>
<P>On the day of the Microsoft announcement, I posted some <A 
href="/item_10169.html">remarks</A> about Team 
Foundation Server here on my weblog.&nbsp; While nothing on my blog is truly 
written in "marketing speak", this post was very positive, almost to the point 
of being sanitized.&nbsp; And not surprisingly, a lot of people didn't believe 
me when I said that SourceGear is going to be okay.</P>
<P>Well, it would be silly for me to write about the Law of Candor today without 
saying more on this topic.&nbsp; So, I've decided to "practice what I preach" by 
making some more remarks about <A

Vault</A>.</P>
