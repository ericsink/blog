<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #14:  The Law of Attributes</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">18 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Attributes says that "for every attribute, there is an opposite, 
effective attribute."</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Fussy</FONT></P>
<P>There was quite an uproar from fans after the recent season finale for <A 
href="http://www.startrek.com/">Star Trek Enterprise</A>.&nbsp; You see, the 
episode contained a serious error.&nbsp; One of the characters states that the 
year is 2152 when in fact, as every Trek fan knows, the current episodes take 
place in the year 2154.</P>
<P>I've heard several people&nbsp;say that&nbsp;this mistake ruined the whole 
episode.</P>
<P>I concede the mistake is silly, but come'on -- the whole episode?&nbsp; 
Perhaps we need a bit of perspective.&nbsp; That date wasn't a central point of 
the show.&nbsp; It's a detail, and aside from the fact that it was incorrect, it 
doesn't matter.</P>
<P>Incidentally, guys, this is the reason why your girlfriend or wife doesn't 
like going to see movies with you.&nbsp; Nobody wants to watch a film with some 
anal-retentive dork who is ready and waiting to discard the entire film because 
the producers made&nbsp;a minor mistake in science or technology.&nbsp; Try to 
just enjoy the movie, or at the very least, shut your pie hole so that she 
can.&nbsp; (This tidbit of relationship advice is provided at no extra 
charge.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif">) </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Marketing Books</FONT></P>
<P>Geeks like us are lousy at marketing for the same reason that nobody wants to 
see movies with us.&nbsp; Marketing books are written for big-picture 
thinkers.&nbsp; They contain broad sweeping generalizations which are only true 
most of the time.&nbsp; Guys like Ries and Trout don't feel the need for a lot 
of precision.</P>
<P>So a geek sits down to read this book.&nbsp; Somehow he manages to cope with 
the word "immutable" in the title, which is obviously a gross 
exaggeration.&nbsp; Somehow he manages to smile at the examples, which are now 
ten years out of date, especially the one about Lotus Notes.&nbsp; Somehow he 
manages to overlook most of the little imprecisions in the first 13 
chapters.</P>
<P>And then, he reaches chapter 14, the Law of Attributes.&nbsp; The subtitle of 
this chapter is "For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective 
attribute."&nbsp; In the mind of this geek, a yellow alert goes off when he sees 
the word "every".&nbsp; Is this really true?&nbsp; Is there 
<STRONG>always</STRONG> an attribute which is both opposite and effective?&nbsp; 
Surely not.&nbsp; Warily, he proceeds.</P>
<P>And then, on the&nbsp;very next page, the authors&nbsp;discuss the market for 
toothpaste, where Crest owns the attribute called "cavity prevention".&nbsp; 
Something in the mind of our geek snaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;'How can&nbsp;there be an 
attribute which is the opposite of "cavity prevention" and which is 
effective?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I knew it all along.&nbsp; This book is a crock!'</P>
<P>The book sails across the room in a high arc as the geek stomps off in 
disgust, no doubt on his way to sign the online petition to have Enterprise 
canceled because T'Pol couldn't remember what year it is.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Choices</FONT></P>
<P>I can't defend the book.&nbsp; This stuff bugs me too.&nbsp; I want marketing 
to be as logical and precise as programming.&nbsp; But it's not.</P>
<P>So if this problem <STRONG>really</STRONG> bother you, then you have&nbsp;two 
choices:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp; Give up on marketing completely.</P>
<P>2.&nbsp; Give up on this chapter and hope the next one is better.</P>
<P>I encourage you to choose option #2.&nbsp; I'm trying to make the world a 
better place here.&nbsp; The gap between technology people and marketing people 
must be bridged.&nbsp; If you give up on getting clueful about marketing, then 
you are implicitly saying that you expect marketing people to get clueful about 
technology.&nbsp; We both know that's not going to happen, so stay with me.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Oh, and by the way...</FONT></P>
<P>Read the chapter.&nbsp; It's a bit redundant with respect to chapters 9 and 
13, but the discussion of Burger King and McDonalds is interesting.</P>
