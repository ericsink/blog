    <p>One of the first things I said in this book is that a VCS repository
        contains every version of everything that has ever happened.</p>

<p>So how does the repository store all that stuff?  Maybe it just keeps a full snapshot of every version of the tree.  Disk space is cheap, right?</p>

<p>Well, it’s not <span class="bold"><strong>that</strong></span> cheap.  If version control data were stored that way, lots of teams would have repositories of 10 TB or more.  
Around this point, the common argument that “disk space is cheap” starts
    to break down.  
    The cost of dealing with 10 TB of important data is much greater
    than just the cost of the actual disk platters.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a huge amount of redundancy in version-controlled data.
    We observe that tree N is often not terribly different from
    tree N-1.  By definition, each version of the tree is derived from its
    predecessor.  A commit might be as simple as a one-line fix to a single
    file.  All of the other files are unchanged; we don’t really need to
    store another copy of them.</p>

<p>So we don’t want to store the full contents of the tree for every single
    change.  Instead, we want a way to store a tree in terms of the changes
    relative to another tree.  We call this a <em class="firstterm">delta</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp2883968"></a>.  All version control tools use some form of
delta concept when storing repository data.</p>

<p>A tree is a hierarchy of directories and files.  A delta is the difference
    between two trees.  In theory, those two trees do not need to be related. 
    However, in practice, the only reason we calculate the difference between
    them is because one of them is derived from the other.  Some developer
    started with tree N and made one or more changes, resulting in tree
    N+1.</p>

<p>We can think of a delta as a 
    list of changes which express the difference between two trees.  This
includes files or directories that have been added, modified, renamed, deleted, or moved.</p>

<p>The delta concept can be used for individual files as well.  A file delta
    merely expresses the difference between two files.  Once
    again, the reason we calculate a file delta is because we believe it will
    be smaller, usually because one of the files is
    derived from the other.</p>

<p>Many modern version control tools use binary file deltas
    for repository storage.  One popular file delta algorithm is called vcdiff<sup>[<a name="idp2887248" href="#ftn.idp2887248" class="footnote">39</a>]</sup><a class="indexterm" name="idp2887920"></a>.
    It outputs a list of byte ranges which have been changed. 
    This means it can handle any kind of file, binary or text.  As an ancillary
    benefit, the vcdiff algorithm compresses the data at the same time.</p>

<p>Binary deltas are a helpful feature for some version control tool users, especially
    in situations where the binary files<a class="indexterm" name="idp2889168"></a> are large.  Consider the case where a
    user checks out a 500 MB file, changes a few bytes, and commits it back in. 
    If the repository is using file deltas,
    it will only grow by a small amount.</p>

<p>Some version control tools can also use binary deltas 
    to improve performance over slow network lines.
    If both sides of the network connection already have version N, then
    transferring version N+1 over the wire can be accomplished by sending
    just a delta.
    The increase in network performance for offsite users can be quite
    dramatic.</p>
