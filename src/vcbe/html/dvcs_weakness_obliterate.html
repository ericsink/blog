    <p>The “Implicit Backup” idea described in the
        previous chapter
             is a coin with two sides.  Having
        lots of copies of the data does reduce the risk of losing that data, but it also
        makes it far more difficult to destroy.</p>

<p>Some version control systems have a way of actually altering the history
    of the repository.  There are certain legitimate situations where we want
    to delete something and have it actually be deleted.
    In general, these situations arise when someone has a legal obligation 
    to destroy all copies of some piece of data.
    It is insufficient to use the <span class="sg-operation">delete</span> operation, since that doesn’t purge the
    data from the repository’s history.  
    This
    feature is commonly known as “obliterate”.
    </p>

    <p>Most version control tools do not support obliterate.
        It is generally agreed 
        that the most important trait for a VCS is reliability.  
        In the pursuit of reliability, anything which allows the history of
        a repository to be altered
        is at best a distraction and at
        worst, damaging.
        In many cases,
        any provision for the ability to obliterate things would cause the
        overall design to be altered in ways that compromise the performance and
        reliability of all operations.
    </p>

    <p>As you can tell, I don’t like obliterate much.  My company has been
        selling version control tools for over a decade, and our experience in
        providing technical support to our customers shows that obliterate is
        often misused.  In my entire career,
        I don’t think I’ve ever found occasion to use obliterate.  
        But I concede that there are valid use cases for it, and the presence of multiple repository instances does make things more difficult, so I mention
        it here.</p>

    <p>With a DVCS, obliterating something would look roughly like this:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Get one repository instance Q which is complete.
                You’ll need to have every repository instance
                push everything to Q.
        </p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
                Clone Q while excluding the parts you want to obliterate.  This
                requires that your DVCS support some kind of a “clone with
                exclude” operation.
            </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
                Destroy all repository instances, replacing them with
                the clone you just created.
            </p>
        </li></ul></div>

    <p>The difficulty of this recipe is determined primarily by the number of
        repository instances you have.  With 10 instances, it’s probably not a
        big problem.  With 5,000 instances, you’ve got a major task on your
        hands.  Fortunately, the need to obliterate is extremely rare.</p>

    <p>Or at least it <span class="bold"><strong>should</strong></span> be.  If your regular process involves a frequent need to obliterate,
        you should not be using a DVCS.  In fact, my opinion would be that
        you should not be using <span class="bold"><strong>any</strong></span> VCS in that kind of situation.
        You’re doing something that version control tools are not designed
        to do.  You don’t need version control.  What you need is something
        else, something that is not the subject of this book.</p>
