<a class="indexterm" name="ndx_begin_cryptographic_hash"></a>

    <p>Most DVCS tools, including Git, Mercurial, and Veracity, use
        cryptographic hashes.</p>

    <p>A cryptographic hash is an algorithm which constructs a short
        <em class="firstterm">digest</em> from a 
        sequence of bytes of any length.  There are many such hash
        algorithms<sup>[<a name="idp2894144" href="#ftn.idp2894144" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup>.
        For
        the SHA-1<sup>[<a name="idp2894864" href="#ftn.idp2894864" class="footnote">41</a>]</sup><a class="indexterm" name="idp2895472"></a> algorithm, the output digest is
        always 160 bits in length.  Some hash algorithms, including SHA-2<sup>[<a name="idp2896096" href="#ftn.idp2896096" class="footnote">42</a>]</sup><a class="indexterm" name="idp2896688"></a> and Skein<sup>[<a name="idp2897200" href="#ftn.idp2897200" class="footnote">43</a>]</sup><a class="indexterm" name="idp2897792"></a>,
        are capable of generating longer digests, at lengths of 256, 512, or even
        1024 bits.</p>

    <div class="section" title="Example with SHA-1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp2898416"></a>Example with SHA-1</h3></div></div></div>
        

    <p>Let’s take a closer look at how a DVCS makes use of cryptographic
        hashes.  I will be using Git<a class="indexterm" name="idp2899744"></a> for my examples in this section, but it
applies to Veracity as well.  Mercurial, on the other hand, does things a bit differently.</p>

<p>In this example, we want to use our VCS to store four text files.  For the sake
of keeping things simple, each
file is just a few bytes long.  (The example would be more realistic if the files
were a lot bigger, but you get the idea.)</p>

<p>Note that even though all four of the input strings are similar, the
resulting hash values are very different.  As you’ll see later, this is important.</p>

    <p>Git uses hashes in two important ways.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>When you commit
        a file into your repository, Git calculates and remembers the hash
        of the contents of the file.  When you later retrieve the file, Git can
        verify that the hash of the data being retrieved exactly matches the
hash that was computed when it was stored.  In this fashion, the hash
        serves as an integrity checksum, ensuring that the data has not been corrupted
        or altered.</p>

        <p>For example, if somebody were to hack the DVCS repository such that
           the contents of <code class="filename">file2.txt</code> were changed to “Fred”, retrieval of that
           file would cause an error because the software would detect that
           the SHA-1 digest for “Fred” is not 63ae94dae606…
</p>
</li><li class="listitem">
    <p>Git also uses hash digests as database keys for looking
        up files and data.
    </p>

    <p>If you ask Git for the contents of <code class="filename">file2.txt</code>, it
        will first look up its previously computed digest for the contents of that file<sup>[<a name="idp2920432" href="#ftn.idp2920432" class="footnote">45</a>]</sup>, which 
         is 63ae94dae606…  Then it looks in the
         repository for the data associated with that value and returns “Erik”
         as the result.  (For the moment, you should try to ignore the fact that
         we just used a 40 character hex string as the database key for four characters
         of data.)
    </p>

</li></ul></div>

    <p>Let’s assume that we now want to add another file,
        <code class="filename">file5.txt</code>, which happens to contain exactly the same string
        as <code class="filename">file2.txt</code>.  So the hash of the
        file contents will be exactly the same.  </p>

<pre class="screen"><span xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format" xmlns:axf="http://www.antennahouse.com/names/XSL/Extensions" class="screen_prompt">eric:hashes_example eric$</span> <span xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format" xmlns:axf="http://www.antennahouse.com/names/XSL/Extensions" class="screen_typed">echo Erik &gt; file5.txt</span>

<span xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format" xmlns:axf="http://www.antennahouse.com/names/XSL/Extensions" class="screen_prompt">eric:hashes_example eric$</span> <span xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format" xmlns:axf="http://www.antennahouse.com/names/XSL/Extensions" class="screen_typed">git hash-object file5.txt</span>
63ae94dae6067d9683cc3a9cea87f8fb388c0e80
</pre>

<p>When Git stores the contents of <code class="filename">file5.txt</code>,
it will realize that it already has a copy of that data.  There
is no need to store it again.  Hooray!  Git just saved us four
bytes of storage space!  (Keep in mind that instead of “Erik”, these
two files could contain a gigabyte of video, which would imply a somewhat
more motivating space savings.)  This process is called
<em class="firstterm">deduplication</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp2927344"></a>.</p>

<p>This is deeply neato, but what would have happened if <code class="filename">file5.txt</code>
did not contain “Erik” but somehow happened to still have a SHA-1 hash of
63ae94dae606…?
According to the pigeonhole principle<sup>[<a name="idp2928928" href="#ftn.idp2928928" class="footnote">46</a>]</sup>, this is theoretically possible.  When a cryptographic hash algorithm generates the same digest for two different pieces of data, we call that a <em class="firstterm">collision</em>.</p>  

<p>If a collision were to happen in this situation, we would have some pretty
big problems.  When the DVCS is asked to store the contents of
<code class="filename">file5.txt</code> (which does not contain “Erik” but which somehow <span class="bold"><strong>does</strong></span> have a SHA-1 hash of 63ae94dae606…), it would
incorrectly
conclude that it already has a copy of that data.  So the real contents of
<code class="filename">file5.txt</code> would be discarded.  Future attempts to
retrieve the contents of that file would erroneously return “Erik”.</p>

    <p>Because of this, it is rather important that the DVCS never encounter
        two different pieces of data which have the same digest.  Fortunately,
        good cryptographic hash functions are designed to make such
        collisions <span class="bold"><strong>extremely</strong></span> unlikely.</p>  

    <p>And just how unlikely is that?</p>
</div>

<div class="section" title="Collisions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp2898672"></a>Collisions</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>
        Your chances of winning the Powerball lottery are
        <span class="bold"><strong>far</strong></span> better than finding a hash
        collision.  After all, lotteries often have actual winners.
        The probability of a hash collision<a class="indexterm" name="idp2936512"></a> is more like a
        lottery that has been running since prehistoric times and has never had
        a winner and will probably not have a winner for
        billions of years.</p>

<p>It is no accident that “Eric”, “Erik”, “eric”, and “Eirc” have
    hash values that are so different.
    Cryptographic hash algorithms
    are intentionally designed 
    to ensure that two similar pieces of data have digests which are not
    similar.</p>

<p>The likelihood of accidentally finding a collision is related to the bit
    length of the
    hash.  Specifically, the average number of evaluations necessary to
    find a collision is 
    <span class="no_line_breaks">2<sup>(bit_length/2)</sup></span>.<sup>[<a name="idp2938544" href="#ftn.idp2938544" class="footnote">47</a>]</sup>  So,
    if we are trying to find two pieces of data which have the same SHA-1 hash,
    we could expect to be searching through 2<sup>80</sup> pieces of
    data.  If we check one
    million hashes per second, we’ll probably find a collision in about 38
    billion years.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, no one has ever found a SHA-1 collision.</p>

<p>Note that these probabilities apply to the situation where a hash
    collision is found accidentally, roughly equivalent to the notion of
    somebody who is just checking random combinations to see if a collision
    happens to
    show up.
    But what if somebody is being a bit more intentional, searching for a collision
    using a better method than just being random?  Surely this search won’t take
    as long if we’re being smart about it, right?</p>

<p>Well, no.  That’s part of the definition of a good cryptographic hash algorithm:  
    There <span class="bold"><strong>is</strong></span> no better method.  If there
    were, then the hash would be considered “broken”.</p>

<p>This is fairly important for a DVCS.  For example, consider
    the situation where somebody has access to a repository containing source
    code for a payroll system.  Their goal is to alter the source code such
    that they will get extra money on payday.</p>

<p>If they can take a source file and then find an altered version of that
    file which has the same SHA-1 hash, they might be able to
    achieve their goal.  Because the SHA-1 hash matches, it is
    quite likely that they could store their altered version in the
    repository without anyone noticing.
</p>

<p>But with a strong cryptographic hash function, it is virtually
    impossible to find <span class="bold"><strong>any</strong></span> string of bytes which
    have the same SHA-1 hash as the original file.  And it
    is even less likely that they could find an altered version which
    accomplishes the goal of giving them more money, or even 
    compiles without errors.</p>

<p>Incidentally, SHA-1 is actually considered broken.  For security-oriented applications, it is
    obsolete and should generally not be used anymore.  
    However, let me explain
    a bit more about what cryptographers mean when they say that SHA-1 is broken.</p>

<p>SHA-1 is considered broken because somebody found a smarter way to search for
    a collision, a method which is more effective than just trying random
    combinations over and over as fast as you can.  But that doesn’t mean that
    finding a collision is easy.  It simply means that the search for a 
    collision in SHA-1 should take less time than
    it is theoretically supposed to take.  Instead of the full 80 bits of
    strength that we would expect SHA-1 to have, it actually has about 51 bits of
    strength.  That means that instead of 38 billion years, we should expect to
    find a collision in about 70 years.
</p>

<p>But still, 70 years is
    a long time.  It remains the case that nobody has ever found a collision in
    SHA-1.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are some who will feel safer using a stronger hash
    algorithm.  
    This is why we decided
    to give Veracity<a class="indexterm" name="idp2948864"></a> support for SHA-2<a class="indexterm" name="idp2949376"></a> and Skein<a class="indexterm" name="idp2949968"></a>, both of which allow
    for 256 bits or more and neither of which has been broken.
    At 256 bits, the search for a collision is going to take a <span class="bold"><strong>long</strong></span> time.
    Instead of one million attempts per second, let’s do a trillion.
    And let’s assume that there are 6 billion people on Earth and every one of
    them has a computer and each of us are doing a trillion checks per second.
    At that rate, it should take us around 2 trillion years to find a collision.</p>
