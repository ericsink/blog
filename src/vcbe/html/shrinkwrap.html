<p>
    Let’s talk first about traditional shrinkwrap<a class="indexterm" name="idp2796320"></a> software.  This is software
    which is licensed to be installed on the end user system.  The “shrinkwrap” name
    sounds funny today because most software of this type now gets delivered
    by download over the Internet with no physical packaging at all.
    But not that long ago, a lot of software was actually pressed onto CD, placed
    in a box, and wrapped in cellophane.  Many people still use the “shrinkwrap”
    term for this kind of software even when plastic wrap is not involved.  </p>

<p>Even without physical packaging, every release of shrinkwrap software
    involves a significant amount of overhead for both the developers (updating
    all the supporting materials and systems) and users (installing everywhere,
    learning the new features, etc.).  Because of this overhead, shrinkwrap
    software tends to get released
    every 3-24 months, with annual releases being a
    typical situation.

    releases,
    along with several maintenance releases.  In this development
process, the team is working on two or three releases at the same time.  Time goes from left to right in the picture.</p>

    Remember that in my DAG<a class="indexterm" name="idp2803760"></a> pictures, I always draw the arrows from child to
    parent<a class="indexterm" name="idp2804272"></a>.  
    Think of these arrows as meaning “is based on”.
    Nonetheless, for merge nodes, this can
    feel a bit counterintuitive, since the changesets are flowing
    in the opposite direction of the arrow.  So in this chapter I
    have shaded the merge nodes green and added an extra green arrow
    to show how things in the merge operation are moving.

<p>
    Let’s talk specifically about how we can use branches to support this kind of
    workflow.  First, we have our main development branch.  We’ll call it
    Master<a class="indexterm" name="idp2811488"></a>.  All of your
development work goes here.  All new feature work goes in here,
and bug-fixes from other branches get merged back into here.
Everything finds its way to Master, directly or indirectly.
I define my workflows such that Master is usually regarded as “somewhat unstable”.<sup>[<a name="idp2812624" href="#ftn.idp2812624" class="footnote">37</a>]</sup>  Insofar as lots of
developers are using it, we want its contents to build and pass test suites.  But this is where work-in-progress goes.
</p>

<div class="section" title="Polishing Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp2813584"></a>Polishing Branches<a class="indexterm" name="idp2814544"></a></h3></div></div></div>
    

<p>
    As development moves along, at some point it is time to begin preparing for
    a release.  This phase of the cycle is often called “QA” or “Testing”,
    but I prefer not to use terminology which suggests that all testing and
    bug-fixing is left until the end.  Best practices in software development
    are to find and fix bugs as early as possible.  So I call this phase “polishing”,
    which is more suggestive of taking something that is basically done and giving
    it the detailed attention it needs to have a really fine fit and finish.
 </p>

 <p>The process of polishing your software to make it ready for release is
     mostly about fixing minor bugs.  But sometimes during this phase,
     stuff happens that should not go into the release.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Sometimes we identify bug-fixes or improvements that are too risky to be included in the release being polished<sup>[<a name="idp2818016" href="#ftn.idp2818016" class="footnote">38</a>]</sup>.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Sometimes feature work on release N+1 begins
            sometime during the Polishing phase of release N.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Sometimes, even though we spent some time during the
            release N cycle building a feature, we decide that
            feature needs to get postponed until release N+1.
        </p>
    </li></ul></div>

<p>If none of the above happened, and the Master branch contains
    <span class="bold"><strong>exactly</strong></span> what will go into the release, and
    absolutely everything that needs to be committed during the Polishing
    phase can go into the release currently being Polished, then we don’t
    need a branch.</p>

<p>But that’s rare.  So we need a branch.  
    We need a way to keep the bug-fixing and polishing of the release separate
    from everything else.
</p>

<p>
So we create a new Polishing branch.
</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Everybody working on this release should switch
and start working in the Polishing branch.  All bug-fixes for the release should be committed directly into the Polishing branch, not into the Master branch.
They will get merged back into Master later.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Anything which needs to be committed but does
        not go into this release should go into Master.
</p></li></ul></div>

<p>Polishing is a short-lived branch.  It exists entirely for the
    purpose of getting something ready for release.  When that something
    is ready, the Polishing branch is closed.
    </p>

    <p>When the polishing is done and the software is nice and shiny, it is time for release.</p>

<div class="figure"><a name="mpr2"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 11.4. A Release Branch</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
    
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/mpr2.jpg" alt="A Release Branch"></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break">

<p>There are three things that happen at Release time.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Create a Release branch off the Polishing branch.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">

            Merge all the changes from the Polishing branch back into Master.

        <p>
            Close the Polishing branch.
        </p>
    </li></ul></div>

    <p>You should always have a
        branch which contains the exact
        contents of your current release.</p>

    <p>Actually, the Release branch almost doesn’t need to be a branch.
      In a perfect world,
      the release is flawless and this branch will never get any more changes
      committed to it.  A branch
      which never gets any commits is effectively a tag.</p>

  <p>But in reality, critical fixes are sometimes necessary.  Users don’t
  always upgrade to the latest release and it is customary to continue providing a certain amount of support and maintenance for older releases, within reason.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Sometimes bugs slip through the Polishing phase and an x.0.1 release is necessary.

        <p>
            Sometimes it is a good idea to do a 1.0.x when 3.0 is released to make their behavior more consistent or compatible in some way.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Sometimes an x.0.1 release is necessary because some other piece of software changed.

<p>When a critical fix is needed, do the fix in the Release branch.  Merge
    it back to Master.</p>

<p>Note that I have been referring to “the” Release branch, as if there is
    only one of them.  In practice, you should keep an open Release branch for
    every major version which was released to customers.  So your release
    branches will likely be named something like “Release_v1” and “Release_v2”
    and so on.</p>

<p>Everything I’m saying in this chapter can be considered as a starting
    point.  Your particular situation  may be much more complicated.  
    You should feel free to tweak things until you have a workflow
   that is effective for your team.  And make sure you’re using a VCS that is
    flexible enough to adapt with you.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

    <p>Sometimes development of new features is too complicated to have just
        one Master branch.  In these situations, it may be helpful to think
        of Master as a cluster of branches.  There is still one main branch called Master where everything eventually ends up,  but we also have subordinate branches called “Feature
        Branches”.</p>

<div class="figure"><a name="feature_branches"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 11.6. Feature Branches</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
    
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/features.jpg" alt="Feature Branches"></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break">

<p>With Feature Branches, developers work on each major feature in a dedicated
    branch.  When the feature is done, it gets merged into Master.  But it is
    also possible to construct a Polishing branch directly from one or more
    Feature branches.  This allows us to make the decision to release only 
    a subset of the features which have been under development.  For example,
    in <a class="xref" href="shrinkwrap.html#feature_branches" title="Figure 11.6. Feature Branches">Figure 11.6, “Feature Branches”</a>, features B and C are not ready for release, so we
    construct a Polishing branch which contains only features A and D.</p>
