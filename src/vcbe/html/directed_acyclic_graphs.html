        <p>In order to support the ability to push and pull changesets between
            multiple instances of the same repository, we need a specially designed
            structure for representing multiple versions of things.  The structure
            we use is called a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)<a class="indexterm" name="idp903984"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp904448"></a>, a design which is more expressive than a purely linear model.  The history of
            everything in the repository is modeled as a DAG.</p>

        <p>Second generation tools tend to model the history of a repository as a line.
            The linear history model is tried and true.  History is a sequence of versions, one after the other, as shown in <a class="xref" href="directed_acyclic_graphs.html#repo_history_line" title="Figure 4.3. Repository History as a Line">Figure 4.3, “Repository History as a Line”</a>.</p>

<div class="figure"><a name="repo_history_line"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.3. Repository History as a Line</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

<p>To create a new version:</p>

<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Grab the latest version</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Make some changes to it</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Check it back in</p>
    </li></ol></div>

<p>People like linear history for its simplicity.  It provides an unambiguous answer to the question of which version is latest.</p>

<p>But the linear model has one big problem:  You can only commit a new version if it was based on the latest version.  And this kind of thing happens a lot:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>I grab the latest version.  At the time I grabbed it, this was version 3.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>I make some changes to it.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>While I am doing this, somebody commits version 4.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>When I go to commit my changes, I can’t, because they are not
            based on the repository’s current version.  The parent<a class="indexterm" name="idp918176"></a> for my changes was
            version 3 because that’s what was current when I started.</p>
    </li></ul></div>

<div class="figure"><a name="repo_history_dag"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.4. Not a Line</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
    
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/repo_history_dag.jpg" alt="Not a Line"></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break">

<p>The linear model of history won’t allow me to create version 5 as shown in
    <a class="xref" href="directed_acyclic_graphs.html#repo_history_dag" title="Figure 4.4. Not a Line">Figure 4.4, “Not a Line”</a>.  Instead, a linear history VCS 
    requires me to take the changes which were made between versions 3 and 4 and
    apply them to my version.  The result is that my working copy’s parent gets changed from
    3 to 4, thus allowing me to commit.</p>

<p>This is unfortunate.  My changes were made against version 3, but now
    they are getting blended with the changes from version 4.  What if they
    don’t blend well?</p>

<p>The obvious question is:  What would happen if we allowed 5 to be checked
    in with 3 as its parent?  Our history would no longer be a line.  Instead
    it would be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).</p>

<p>A DAG is a data structure from computer science which can be used to model a wide variety of problems.  The DAG consists of the following elements:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Nodes.  Each node represents some object or piece
            of data.  In the case of a DVCS, each node represents one revision
            of the entire repository tree.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Directed edges.  A directed edge (or “arrow”) from one node to another represents some kind of
            relationship between those two nodes.  In our situation, the arrow
            means “is based on”.  By convention, I draw DAG arrows from child
            to parent, from the new revision to the revision from which it was
            derived.  Arrows in a DAG may not form a cycle.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            A root node.  At least one of the nodes will have no parents.  This is the
            root of the DAG.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            Leaf nodes.  One or more of the nodes will have no children.  These
            are called leaves or leaf nodes.
        </p>
    </li></ul></div>
    
<p>A major feature of the DAG model for history is that it doesn’t
    interrupt the developer at the moment she is trying to commit her work.
    In this fashion, the DAG is probably a more pure representation of what
    happens in a team practicing concurrent development.  Version 5 was in fact
    based on version 3, so why not just represent that fact?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a darn good reason why not.  In the DAG
    above, we don’t know which version is “the latest”.  This causes all kinds
    of problems:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
        Suppose we need the changes in versions 4 and 5 in order to ship our
        release.  Currently we can’t have that.  There is no version in the
        system that includes both.
</p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
        Our build system is configured to always build the latest version.  What is it supposed to do now?
</p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
        Even if we build both 4 and 5, which one is QA supposed to test?
</p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
        If a developer wants to update her working copy to the latest version, which one is it?
        When a developer wants to make some changes, which version should he use as the baseline?
</p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
        Our project manager wants to know which tasks are done and how much
        work is left to do.  His notion of “done” is very closely associated
        with the concept of “latest”.  If he can’t figure out which version is
        latest, his brain is likely to just blue screen when he tries to update
        the Gantt chart.
</p></li></ul></div>
<p>Yep, this is a bad scene.  Civilization as we know it will probably just shut down. </p>

<p>In order to avoid dogs and cats living together with mass hysteria, the
    tools that use a DAG model of history provide a way to resolve the mess.
    The answer is the same as it is with linear history.  We need a merge.  But
    instead of requiring the developer to merge before committing, we allow
    that merge to happen later.</p>

<p>Somebody needs to construct a version which contains all the changes in
    both version 4 and version 5.  When this version gets committed, it will
    have arrows pointing to both of its “parents” as shown by version 6 in <a class="xref" href="directed_acyclic_graphs.html#repo_history_dag_merged" title="Figure 4.5. Sort of like a Line">Figure 4.5, “Sort of like a Line”</a>. </p>

<div class="figure"><a name="repo_history_dag_merged"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.5. Sort of like a Line</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
    
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/repo_history_dag_merged.jpg" alt="Sort of like a Line"></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break">

<p>Order has been restored.  Once again we know which version is “the latest”.  If somebody bothers to reboot the project manager, he will probably realize that this DAG looks almost like a line.  Except for that weird stuff happening between versions 3 and 6, it is a line.  Best not to lose sleep over it.</p>

<p>What this project manager doesn’t know is that this particular crisis was minor.  He thinks that his paradigm has been completely challenged, but one day he’s going to come into his office and find something like the picture in <a class="xref" href="directed_acyclic_graphs.html#repo_history_dag_chaos" title="Figure 4.6. Not even close to being a Line">Figure 4.6, “Not even close to being a Line”</a>.</p>

<div class="figure"><a name="repo_history_dag_chaos"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.6. Not even close to being a Line</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
    
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/repo_history_dag_chaos.jpg" alt="Not even close to being a Line"></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break">

<p>Now what?  
    If you’re living in the linear history paradigm, this DAG is an absolute
    disaster.  It has <span class="bold"><strong>four</strong></span> leaf nodes.  Everything that needs to know which
    version is latest is about to completely fall apart, including the
    aforementioned product manager who is probably now in his office curled up
    in a fetal position and hoping that Mommy included cookies with his
    SpaghettiOs for lunch.</p>

<p>The linear history model is looking pretty good right now.  There’s a good reason
    why 99.44% of developers are using a version control tool built on the notion of history as a line.
     (Yes, I made that statistic up.)</p>

    <p>And yet, despite all this apparent chaos, we should remind ourselves
        of the primary benefit of the DAG model:  It more accurately describes
        the way developers work.  It doesn’t make developers bend to its will
        like the linear model does.  When a developer wants to check something
        in, she does, and the DAG merely records what happened.</p>

        <p>Many teams will always prefer the linear history model, even if it requires them to make their development process compatible with it, and there’s nothing
            wrong with that.  Life is simpler that way.</p>

        <p>But the DAG model is more flexible and expressive, and many teams
            can benefit from a VCS which has those qualities. </p>

        <p>And for other teams, the DAG model might be coming along simply
            because they want to use a DVCS tool for other reasons.  DVCS tools
            use a DAG because they have to.  If we can’t assume a live
            connection to a central server<a class="indexterm" name="idp952016"></a>, there isn’t any way to force
            developers to make everything fit into the linear model.</p>

        <p>So we need to figure out ways of coping with the DAG.  How do we
            do this?</p>

        <p>One way is to reframe every operation.  If you tell a doctor that
            “it hurts when I need to know which version is latest”, the doctor
            will tell you to “stop doing that”.  Instead, always specify
            exactly which node to use:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
        The build machine doesn’t build the latest node.  Instead, it builds whichever node we tell it to build.  Or maybe it builds every node.
</p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
        QA tests whichever build somebody decides they should test.
</p></li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
        Developers don’t update their tree to “the latest”.  Instead, they look at the DAG, pick a node, and update to that one.
</p></li></ul></div>

            <p>
        I’m not saying this approach is always practical.  I am merely observing that
        it is conceptually valid.  If you want your DAG to have multiple leaf nodes,
        you can do that.
        As long as you’re willing to specify which
        node you want to use, any operation that needs a node can proceed.
</p>

<p>
    In practice, the most common solution to this problem is to have stricter
    rules about the shape of the DAG on the central server<a class="indexterm" name="idp957936"></a>.
    In other words, developers are allowed to have all manner of DAG chaos in
    their private repository instances, but the DAG on the central server must
    have a single leaf node.
</p>

<p>
    Typically, a DVCS will warn you if you are attempting
    a push which would make the remote repository’s DAG messy.  Users of
    Mercurial and Veracity would typically handle this situation by doing a
    pull, then a merge, and then retrying the push.
</p>

<p>
    Git users often handle this situation differently, using Git’s <em class="firstterm">rebase</em>
    feature<a class="indexterm" name="idp960144"></a>.  Rebase is a way of rewriting changesets, replacing them with
    new ones that are exactly equivalent but which have different
    parents<a class="indexterm" name="idp960960"></a>.  The way this feature is typically used is to rewrite DAG history
    as a line.  In other words, even though Git is clearly a third generation
    version control tool, many of its users prefer the cleaner, linear
    history of a second generation tool.</p>

<p>Because Git’s rebase command alters things which have already been
    committed to a repository instance, it often serves as a launching
    point for arguments among DVCS fans with different perspectives on
    the immutability<a class="indexterm" name="idp962368"></a> of a repository instance.</p>

<p>One final note about DAGs:  It would be conceptually valid to use the
    notion of a DAG to discuss the divergence of any part of a repository.
    However, when we speak of a DAG with respect to a DVCS, we’re talking
    about the whole tree.  This is how branching works in DVCS land—each
    node of the DAG is a version of the whole tree<a class="indexterm" name="idp963616"></a>.  This contrasts with
    CVCS tools where most popular implementations model a branch as
    a directory in the tree which was branched from another directory
    in the tree.</p>
