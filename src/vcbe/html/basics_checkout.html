<p class="verb_concise"><a class="indexterm" name="idp199888"></a>Create a working copy.</p>
<p>The <span class="sg-operation">checkout</span> operation is used when you need to make a new working copy for a repository that already exists.</p>

<p>A working copy<a class="indexterm" name="idp200880"></a> is a copy used for, er, working.</p>
<p>A working copy is a snapshot of the repository used by a developer as a place to make changes.  The repository is shared by the whole team, but people do not modify it directly.  Rather, 
    each individual developer works by using a working copy.
      The working copy provides her with a private workspace where she can do her work isolated from the rest of the team.</p>

<p>The life of a developer is an infinite loop which looks something like this:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>10 Make a working copy of the contents of the repository.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>20 Modify the working copy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>30 Modify the repository to incorporate those modifications.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>40 GOTO 20</p></li></ul></div>

<p>Let’s imagine for a moment what life would be like without this
    distinction between working copy and repository.  In a single-person team,
    the situation could be described as tolerable.  However, for any number of
    developers greater than one, things can get very messy.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people try it.  They store their code on a file server. 
    Everyone uses network file sharing and edits the source files in place. 
    When somebody wants to edit <code class="filename">main.cpp</code>, they shout across the hall and ask if
    anybody else is using that file.  Their Ethernet is saturated most of the
    time because the developers are actually compiling on their network
    drives.</p>

<p>With a version control tool, working on a multi-person team is much simpler.  Each
    developer has a working copy to use as a private workspace<a class="indexterm" name="idp208880"></a>.  He can make
    changes to his own working copy without adversely affecting the rest of the
    team.</p>

<p>
    The working copy is actually more than just a snapshot of the contents
    of the repository.  It also contains some metadata so that it can keep
    careful track of the state of things.
</p>

<p>Let’s suppose I have a brand new working copy.  In other words, I started
    with nothing at all and I retrieved the latest versions from the
    repository.  At this moment, my new working copy is completely synchronized
    with the contents of the repository.  But that condition is not likely to
    last for long.  I will be making changes to some of the files in this
    working copy so it will become newer than the repository.  Other
    developers may be checking in their changes to the repository, thus making
    my working copy out of date.  My working copy is going to be new and
    old at the same time.  Things are going to get confusing.  The version control tool is
    responsible for keeping track of everything.  In fact, it must keep track
    of the state of each file individually.</p>

<p>For housekeeping purposes, the version control tool usually keeps a bit of extra
    information with the working copy.  When a file is retrieved, the VCS 
    stores its contents in the corresponding working copy of that file, but it
    also records
    certain information.  For example:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Your version control tool may record the timestamp on the working file so that it
            can later detect if you have modified it. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It may record the version number of the repository file that was
    retrieved so that it may later know the starting point from which you
    began to make your changes. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It may even tuck away a complete copy of the file that was retrieved
        so that it can show you a diff without accessing the server.</p></li></ul></div>

<p>This stuff is stored in the <em class="firstterm">administrative area</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp215280"></a>, which is usually one or more hidden directories in the working copy.  Its exact location
    depends on which version control tool you are using.
