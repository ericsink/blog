      <p>
          I appreciate and want to acknowledge the efforts of
          those who helped me during the production of this book.
      </p>

      <p>
          Two of my coworkers at SourceGear have been involved
          in this project in very substantial ways.
      </p>

                  Everything about this book that <span class="italic">looks</span> good is a credit to
                  John Woolley.  And if there is anything about this book that
                  does not look good, that was probably an area where I got
                  in his way.
              </p>

              <p>
                  John did the design, the layout, the illustrations,
                  the cover, the font choices, everything.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Personally, I think the book looks fantastic.  My thanks to
                  John Woolley.

                  The back of the title page lists Brody Finney as the “Editor”
                  of this book, but that does not fully describe his contributions.
              </p>

              <p>While it is true that Brody’s pedantry and red ink were
                  critical, he and I also spent much time talking
                  through issues of structure and content.  He has been my
                  sounding board on everything from British slang to the
                  explanations of version control concepts.
              </p>

              <p>
                  My thanks to Brody Finney for the many and varied ways that
                  he made the content of this book better.
              </p>
          </li></ul></div>

      <p>I received all kinds of helpful comments and constructive feedback
          from folks who read early drafts of this book.</p>

                  My original plan was to keep this section of the
                  acknowledgments very simple, like the alphabetical list
                  above, with no attempt to
                  describe how much feedback each person provided me.
              </p>

              <p>
                  This plan was utterly ruined by Jakub Narębski, whose
                  feedback during the editing process was extraordinary.  He found
                  errors no one else found.  He gave me pages of background commentary.
                  He wrote drafts of content
                  he felt was too important not to cover.
              </p>

              <p>
                  I appreciate the comments I received from <span class="bold"><strong>every</strong></span> person who reviewed
                  my book, but trust me on this one—Jakub’s feedback was
                  in a class by itself.
              </p>
          </li></ul></div>

      <p>It takes a lot of focus to write a book.
          Several people supported me in the writing of this book
          by covering for my absence and offering me their patience.
          My thanks to:</p>
