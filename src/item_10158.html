<P>Sorry for the&nbsp;off-topic post, but&nbsp;the <A 
href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/03/11/spain.blasts/index.html">bombings</A> 
in Madrid today are somewhat of a personal issue for me.</P>
<P>I used to live in the Madrid area.&nbsp; In fact, I rode through all three of 
those train stations every day on my way to work.&nbsp; I still have many 
friends there, and I hope to hear soon that they are all safe.&nbsp; My 
condolences and prayers are with the victims and their families.</P>
