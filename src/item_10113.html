<P><A href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</A> was great.&nbsp; The 
atmosphere was very different from most conferences I've attended.&nbsp; I think 
we had 500-600 attendees.&nbsp; The registration desk was staffed by Chris' 
Mom.&nbsp; Two of the people who seemed to be a part of the conference staff 
were under the age of 12, and they looked like they were working just as hard 
and having just as much fun as everybody else.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Des Moines was surprisingly impressive.&nbsp; They say the area has around 
500,000 people, which is a lot bigger than I thought it would be.&nbsp; The 
locals were unusually friendly people.&nbsp; And the skywalk system in their 
downtown area is just very cool.</P>
<P>As always, I like meeting people in person after "meeting" them in the realm 
of IP packets.&nbsp; This time I met <A 
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rholloway/">Randy Holloway</A> and <A 
href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/">Brad Wilson</A>, not to mention <A 
href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo</A> and his staff.&nbsp; As a 
bonus, I happened to cross paths with an old friend I had not seen in 12 
years.&nbsp; Small world.</P>
<P>I am&nbsp;simply amazed at the caliber of speakers Chris was able to 
attract.&nbsp;&nbsp;The big names were&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3563">Tim O'Reilly</A>, John Dvorak, <A 
href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan Gillmor</A> and <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/">Rob Malda</A>, not to mention speakers from 
Microsoft, Google, and Ziff-Davis.&nbsp; The other speaker 
was&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown person from an unknown&nbsp;company, but I seemed to be 
the only one who noticed that&nbsp;"Eric Sink"&nbsp;didn't really&nbsp;belong 
with the rest of those names.&nbsp; Thanks to the Lockergnome staff and to the 
attendees for the warm welcome and all the positive followup remarks.</P>
<P>Chris was proclaiming this to be the most-blogged conference ever.&nbsp; He 
may have been right.&nbsp; In fact, I got "busted" because of the level of 
blogging at this event.&nbsp; During the Q&amp;A time after my talk, I made an 
off-the-cuff remark, saying that there are more VB programmers on the planet 
than chickens.&nbsp; Randy <A 
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rholloway/posts/10542.aspx">blogged</A> this 
remark, and the next day I had email from <A 
href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sells</A> asking me to cite the 
source of my data on the world's poultry population.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I was 
deliberately exaggerating, as a way of emphasizing just how many VB programmers 
there are.&nbsp; Yes, there are lots of them, but it turns out there are far 
more chickens on earth than most people think.&nbsp; In fact, they slightly 
outnumber the human beings.&nbsp; Luckily, we're taller.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif">
