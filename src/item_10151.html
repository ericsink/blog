title: The Vault Single User Edition is dead...
---

<P>... Long live the Vault Single User Edition</P>
<P>With our new pricing for Vault, some&nbsp;readers will note that&nbsp;we have 
eliminated the "Single User Edition".&nbsp; Previously priced at $49, this offering was&nbsp;quite 
popular with self-employed consultants and their ilk.&nbsp; In place of the 
Single User Edition product, we have implemented what could be called&nbsp;an 
"<EM>Implicit</EM> Single User Edition".&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell,&nbsp;Vault is 
now free for one user.&nbsp; Just <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads.asp">download</A> the Vault 
binaries and install them.&nbsp; You don't need a serial number at all.&nbsp; 
With no serial numbers, Vault 2.0 is hard-coded to behave as if there is one 
license.</P>
