MacOS X is taking a nice <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-843783.html">step</a> forward.  I still really like the idea of a solid UNIX core with a consumer-grade GUI on top.  But I'm still waiting for OS X to mature a bit more.  The availability of Photoshop is a nice signal, even though I don't even use that app.
