<P>I ran across an interesting <A 
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/jug-discussion@tucson-jug.org/msg00355.html">tale</A> 
which attempts to explain how Java Swing became so lame.&nbsp; This explains a 
lot.&nbsp; Java is a technology that I really wanted to like.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately our attempts to use Java for GUI work were very disappointing.</P>
<P><EM>(Edited:&nbsp;&nbsp;I was later&nbsp;told the above tale was a 
hoax.&nbsp; The link now seems broken as well.)</EM></P>
<P>On Windows, C# (with Windows Forms) is what Java should have been.&nbsp; We 
used it to create <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear 
Vault</A>, and the result was an app which feels completely native on 
Windows.&nbsp; I'd obviously like to see this technology become cross-platform, 
but for now, .NET is a great way to write real apps for Windows.</P>
