<P>I want .NET on Linux, Solaris and MacOS X.&nbsp; We need non-Windows clients 
for SourceGear Vault.&nbsp; We know how to write good cross-platform C++ code, 
but now that we've had a taste of C#, we don't want to do that anymore.&nbsp; It 
would be much easier if you would just make our managed code portable.</P>
<P>To be more specific:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>From our perspective, the client is the only part that needs to be 
  cross-platform.&nbsp; We're happy running the server forever on Windows 
  2000/2003/2008. 
  <LI>I would settle for a subset of the Framework if that makes the decision 
  easier.&nbsp; Even if you left out Windows Forms, it would be very useful. 
  <LI>Yes, we would be willing to pay money.&nbsp; If we linked the .NET runtime 
  into our app, we could just pay a royalty for every copy we sold.</LI></UL>
<P>Even better, why not license the .NET runtime to other OS vendors the same 
way you license Windows to PC vendors?&nbsp; You get $100 or so for every 
Windows license, right?&nbsp; If you can get that same $100 from a Linux or 
MacOS user who wants to run .NET apps, why not?</P>
<P>PS.&nbsp; Yes, I know about Rotor.&nbsp; The problem is that I can't ship 
Rotor with my app.&nbsp; I'm not personally interested in research or studying 
the way the CLR functions.&nbsp; I just want to ship a cross-platform product 
and I want .NET to be my cross-platform solution.</P>
<P>PPS.&nbsp; Yes, I know about Java.&nbsp; Don't get me started.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>PPPS.&nbsp; Yes, I know about <A 
href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</A>.&nbsp; This solution looks promising, 
but it's not mature enough yet to run even the Vault command-line client.&nbsp; 
Not yet.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
