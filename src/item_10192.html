With the recent announcement of Microsoft's Team Foundation Server (TFS), 
a lot of people are&nbsp;wondering about the future of SourceGear Vault. 
<p>On 24 May, I said <a href="/item_10169.html">a 
few things</a> about this topic. In a nutshell, I claimed that SourceGear will 
be affected, but that we will be okay.&nbsp; I still believe that. 
</p>
<p>But as I expected, not everybody believes me. On Joel Spolsky's discussion 
board, somebody named "JT" recently <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=152765&amp;ixReplies=37">wrote</a>: 

</p>
<blockquote>"I've got a great deal of respect for Eric Sink and my heart sank 
  a little when I heard the news that MS was going to enter the source control 
  market because I knew this would be bad for Eric. (Regardless of what Eric 
  says, I think it will be far worse for him than what he is saying.)" 
</blockquote>
First let me say that I take no offense at remarks like this.&nbsp; 
JT is entitled to his/her opinion.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no proof of my 
claims.&nbsp; Time will tell if I am right or wrong.&nbsp; 
<p>Nonetheless, I think I make myself less credible by not showing <b>both</b> 
sides of my feelings about this whole situation. If the only thing that you hear 
from me is a positive spin, you are not sure whether to believe me or not. One 
of the reasons that I write here in my weblog is that I want to be real, so I'd 
like to take a moment and provide some balance. 
</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the&nbsp;TFS team started serious development 
somewhere around the fall of 2002.&nbsp; Throughout the first half of 2003, we 
heard rumors about it.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>In early September 2003, we got confirmation from Microsoft.&nbsp; Believe 
me, I was angry.&nbsp; I ranted and I vented.&nbsp; I used a few words my mother 
taught me not to use. 
</p>
<p>The scene of this announcement was weird.&nbsp; It was an NDA'd&nbsp;meeting 
of the VSIP program.&nbsp; All of the attendees were vendors of components or 
developers tools which integrate with Visual Studio.&nbsp; Standing in front of 
dozens of their so-called "partners", Microsoft staff put smiles on their faces 
and announced that they will be competing with&nbsp;almost all of us. 
</p>
<p>There was a lot of emotion in that room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every&nbsp;VSIP 
vendor&nbsp;had worked very hard to be a part of Microsoft's "ecosystem" for 
Visual Studio, only to end up feeling very betrayed.&nbsp; If this is how 
Microsoft treats its partners, how do they treat their enemies? 
</p>
<p>Incidentally, I thought the&nbsp;most interesting&nbsp;aspect of this meeting 
was watching the individuals who were part of Microsoft's VSIP team.&nbsp; As a 
system, Microsoft does not&nbsp;truly care about its ISVs, but many individual 
Microsoft employees really do.&nbsp; In fact, those people are exactly the sort 
of people who end up working in partner programs like VSIP.&nbsp; I felt some 
sympathy for these folks, as they were the ones who had to facilitate the 
delivery of the bad news. 
</p>
<p>Just a few days before this announcement, Chris Sells had asked me to write a 
monthly column for MSDN.&nbsp; When we heard that&nbsp;news from Microsoft, I 
nearly called Chris and told him where to stick&nbsp;his Longhorn Developer 
Center.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif" /> 
</p>
<p>Instead, I calmed down and made a choice:&nbsp; I was angry, but I decided 
that I would not spend my life whining.&nbsp; My deadline was approaching, so I 
sat down and wrote my first MSDN column, <a href="/bos/Whining_by_a_Barrel_of_Ro.html">Whining 
by a Barrel of Rocks</a>. 
</p>
<p>My beliefs about SourceGear's future have not changed since I wrote that 
article.&nbsp; I said it then, and I will say it again now:&nbsp; Markets are 
not as "black-and-white" as we think. 
</p>
<p>Without competition from Microsoft, SourceGear was drooling at the 
possibility of annual revenue in the 8-figure range.&nbsp; (I consider that to 
be a heckuva a lot of money for a small ISV with no venture capital 
backing.)&nbsp; This outcome is no longer likely, but with some clever changes 
to strategy, SourceGear can still be very successful.&nbsp; Even with Microsoft 
in this market, we are going to continue having annual revenues of several 
million per year. 
</p>
<p>As the release of Visual Studio 2005 gets closer, more and more information 
will become available, and the world will begin to understand that TFS is not 
for everyone.&nbsp; Even now, details are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2004/06/16/157022.aspx">starting</a> 
to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2004/06/10/152609.aspx">appear</a>.&nbsp; 
I predict that TFS will be an outstanding product and a big success, but there 
will continue to be a lot of developers who want other choices, for one reason 
or another. 
</p>
<p>SourceGear will be here for those developers.&nbsp; Ever since September, we 
have been adapting our strategy.&nbsp; We have done and are continuing to do the 
things necessary to allow SourceGear to thrive.&nbsp; Our sales have continued 
to be extremely strong.&nbsp; Our customers continue to tell us how much they 
love our products. 
</p>
<p>Believe me. Don't believe me. Your choice. But I'm not going anywhere.
