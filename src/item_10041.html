Kudos to Microsoft for releasing Visual Studio.NET yesterday.  The official release date is apparently still in February, but "the stuff" is available for download at their site.<br><br>I've been using VS.NET for several months, and I'll reluctantly say that I am impressed.  I'm not an IDE person.  Emacs and bash have always been sufficient, even on Windows.  VS.NET is probably the first release of Visual Studio that I've really liked since version 4.0.<p>
Funny tidbit:  Somebody in our QA team found a reproducible bug in Notepad last week!  I'm still trying to figure out why he was looking for bugs <b>there</b>, but what a great thing to have on his r&eacute;sum&eacute;.
Could Google be any more cool?  Bear with me:<br><br>
I was helping my daughter Kellie (7 yrs old) with a geography game from school.  She had to find out what state the following three islands are in: kodiak, nunivak, and baranof.<br><br>
<b>Eric:</b>  So where do we start?<br><br>
<b>Kellie:</b>  Google!<br><br>
(Kellie brings up google.com and types the three island names above.  She <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=kodiak+nunvak+baraof">mistypes</a> two of them.)<br><br>
<b>Google:</b>  Did you mean: kodiak <i>nunivak</i> <i>baranof</i><br><br>
<b>Kellie:</b>  Silly Google!<br><br>
