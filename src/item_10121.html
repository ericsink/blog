title: J# Skepticism

<P>I'm skeptical about J#.</P>
<P>I've&nbsp;been quite&nbsp;surprised at the way Microsoft is <A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/whitepapers/default.aspx">positioning</A> 
their four main .NET languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprising part is that there are 
four languages instead of three.&nbsp; </P>
<P>These three languages all make sense to me:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>VB.NET (for people who don't want to wear out the semicolon on their 
  keyboard) 
  <LI>C++ (for people who pride themselves on using a language that few people 
  really understand) 
  <LI>C# (for people like me who really just want a Java clone)</LI></UL>
<P>But the fourth language doesn't seem to fit into this crowd.&nbsp; Does J# 
have a place in the long term?&nbsp; Several times recently, Microsoft's 
articles have described J# as if it were a full-fledged peer of its three 
siblings.&nbsp; But each time I see this, I find myself wanting to stand and 
applaud a really fine acting job.&nbsp; Who at Microsoft really believes J# is 
here to stay?</P>
<P>I've got two reasons for my skepticism about the long term future of J#:</P>
<P>First reason:&nbsp; Does anybody in Redmond actually eat this dogfood?&nbsp; 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Microsoft has a dismal track record of maintaining and improving developer 
  tools it does not actually use for its own products.&nbsp; I have a strong 
  suspicion that nobody at Microsoft is actually using J#, except for all the 
  interns writing samples for it.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>People would find it much easier to put&nbsp;their trust in J# if we 
  started hearing stories about how Microsoft is depending on J# for their next 
  product.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Second reason:&nbsp; Porting Java to C# is just too easy.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>The server for <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite 
  Classic</A> was written in Java, actually&nbsp;Visual J++ 6, running on the 
  Microsoft JVM.&nbsp; Unfortunately all support for this JVM has ceased, so it 
  looks like we need to move.</P>
  <P>We tried porting to J#, although I'll admit we didn't try very hard.&nbsp; 
  If the port to J# had been completely painless and free of effort, we would 
  probably be on J# now.&nbsp; But it didn't <EM>Just Work</EM>.</P>
  <P>So we tossed J# and ported to C#, which turned out to be really easy.&nbsp; 
  Whole sections of code compiled and worked with no change at 
all.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>I think Microsoft has a <A 
href="/Positioning.html">positioning</A> clash 
here.&nbsp; C# has the position that J# wants.&nbsp; Both languages are being 
perceived as&nbsp;"the Microsoft&nbsp;replacement for Java".&nbsp; The market 
will not let both languages have this position -- one must lose.&nbsp; 
Suspicions about Microsoft's long-term committment to J# will be the deciding 
factor, and C# will be the one left standing in the end.</P>
