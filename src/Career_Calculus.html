teaser: I submit that worrying about how others perceive your C value is a waste of time. The key to a great career is to focus on L, the first derivative of the equation. L is the rate at which your cluefulness is changing over time. The actual value of C at any given moment is usually a distraction. Only one question matters: With each day that goes by, are you getting more clueful, or less clueful? Or are you just stuck?

<p>A couple weeks ago there was a flurry of blogging over the price of Microsoft's upcoming Professional Developers Conference (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/">PDC</a>).&nbsp; In the midst of this controversy, Doug Reilly chimed in with a post entitled "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dreilly/archive/2003/08/09/23345.aspx">Who is responsible for your career?</a>".&nbsp; Doug's post got a lot of reads and links, including well-said&nbsp;"amen posts"&nbsp;from <a href="http://samgentile.com/blog/posts/9394.aspx">Sam Gentile</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/archive/2003/08/10/23424.aspx">Robert Hurlbut</a>.</p><p>While I don't care to debate the issue of PDC pricing, I do&nbsp;want to affirm the concept&nbsp;of taking responsibility for&nbsp;our own careers.&nbsp; Often we choose to focus on the things which are outside our control.&nbsp; But the truth is that our career path is largely determined by our own choices.</p><p>I've known and worked with lots of developers, and I have noticed one thing which separates&nbsp;those with great careers from everybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers&nbsp;with outstanding careers understand&nbsp;a secret that seems to elude the majority:</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Focus on the first derivative.</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">And You thought Math would Never be Useful</font></p><p>Remember your introductory calculus?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; You were either a horny high school senior or a hung-over college freshman, so you weren't paying attention.&nbsp; But there in the first few chapters of your calc textbook is a hint about the secret of your career path.&nbsp; </p><p>In basic calculus we learned that the first derivative of a function is the "rate of change" of the value of that function with respect to another variable.&nbsp; In the case of your career, the other variable is time.&nbsp; The basic equation for a developer career looks like this:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">  <p><font face="Courier New,Courier,monospace" size="4"><strong>C = G +   LT</strong></font></p>  <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">    <p>C is <strong>Cluefulness</strong>.&nbsp; It is defined as an overall     measure of your capabilities, expertise, wisdom and knowledge in the field     of software development.&nbsp; It is the measure of how valuable you are to     an employer.&nbsp; It is the measure of how successful your career is.&nbsp;     When you graph your career, C is on the vertical axis.</p>    <p>G is <strong>Gifting</strong>.&nbsp; It is defined as the amount of     natural cluefulness you were given "at the     factory".&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;each individual, G&nbsp;is a     constant,&nbsp;but it definitely&nbsp;varies from person to person.</p>    <p>L is <strong>Learning</strong>.&nbsp; It is defined as the&nbsp;rate at     which you&nbsp;gain (or lose) cluefulness over time.</p>    <p>T is <strong>Time</strong>.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;on the horizontal&nbsp;axis     of&nbsp;your career&nbsp;graph.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As you can see above, your career success is determined by three variables, only one of which you can control:</p><ul>  <li>You obviously can't control T.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time marches forward   mercilessly&nbsp;at the same rate for everyone.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>You also can't control G.&nbsp; The truth is that some people are just   naturally smarter than you are, and that's the way it is.&nbsp; But G is not   the sole determiner of your success.&nbsp; I have known some truly gifted   programmers with lame careers,&nbsp;and I have also known some less-gifted   folks who have become extremely successful.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>You <em>can</em> make choices which affect the value of L.&nbsp; In fact,   you <em>do</em> make choices which affect the value of L, every day, whether   you know it or not.
</li>
</ul><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Focus on the First Derivative</font></p><p>Old habits die hard.&nbsp; Focusing on the first derivative can be very difficult to do, as&nbsp;our natural inclination is to focus on C itself.</p><ul>  <li>We wonder why somebody else got the promotion.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</li>
<li>We wonder why the boss doesn't seem to value&nbsp;our ideas as much as   some other person.&nbsp; <br /><br />
</li>
<li>When&nbsp;we&nbsp;apply for&nbsp;a job,&nbsp;we submit a&nbsp;document   which is filled with&nbsp;claims&nbsp;about how high our C value is.&nbsp;
</li>
</ul><p>We convince ourselves that the real problem is that people don't seem to know how clueful we are.&nbsp; Over time, we come to believe that the important thing is not our actual cluefulness but rather the degree to which others perceive us as clueful. </p><p>I submit that worrying about how others perceive your C value is a waste of time.&nbsp; The key to a great career is to focus on L, the first derivative of the equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;L is the rate at which your cluefulness is changing over time.&nbsp; The actual value of C at any given moment is usually a distraction.&nbsp; Only one question matters:&nbsp; With each day that goes by, are you getting more clueful, or less clueful?&nbsp; Or are you just stuck?</p><p align="center"><img height="255" alt="" src="/calculus_lame.gif" width="422" border="0" /></p><p>Sound obvious?&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp; Most people don't get this, and you will leave your peers in the dust if you do.&nbsp; For&nbsp;most developers, L is zero.&nbsp; Any positive value for L can elevate you above the crowd.</p><p align="center"><img height="255" alt="" src="/calculus_outstanding.gif" width="422" border="0" /></p><p>When you make L into a positive number, you have a great career happening.&nbsp; It no longer matters what G was.&nbsp; You are getting more clueful every day, and that means your opportunities are going to get better in the future.</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Constant Learning</font></p><p>I started with the example of paying your own way to PDC.&nbsp; Yes, this is&nbsp;one example of a positive L.&nbsp; Go to PDC and you'll learn about C# generics and query optimization for Yukon and managed APIs in Longhorn and all kinds of other stuff.&nbsp; In the last week of October, your Cluefulness will increase.</p><p>But PDC only happens every&nbsp;couple&nbsp;years or so.&nbsp; How are you going to keep L positive the rest of the time?&nbsp; A great career is not likely to happen if L merely spikes above zero once in a while.&nbsp; We need "constant learning".&nbsp; </p><p>We want learning to be&nbsp;a process, not an event.&nbsp; Making your first derivative constantly positive is not just about formal training.&nbsp; It is a posture which you bring to your job each day.&nbsp; It is a posture of teachability, a constant willingness to learn.</p><p>What opportunities do you have for learning on a typical day as a developer?&nbsp; You spend approximately 250 days a year sitting in front of a keyboard and a screen.&nbsp; For how many of those days can you make L a positive number?</p><p>Unfortunately these are questions you have to answer for yourself.&nbsp; When you start looking at things from this perspective, you will find your own ways to be constantly learning.&nbsp; The implementation specifics depend almost entirely on you and your work environment.</p><p>But there is one big factor which is holding back L for almost everybody.&nbsp; The most important learning experiences in day-to-day work are the opportunities to learn from our mistakes.</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Seize&nbsp;Your Mistakes</font></p><p>In between formal training events like PDC, our mistakes are the peaks in our opportunities for learning.&nbsp; Our value of L is heavily determined by the way we handle those mistakes.</p><p>My own mistakes have been the difference-makers in my career.&nbsp; When SourceGear won the Inc 500 award last fall, the editors asked me to name the most surprising thing I had learned from being an entrepreneur.&nbsp; I told them the most surprising thing was that I could make so many dumb mistakes and still end up on the Inc 500 list.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; </p><p>I've been running my own company for almost seven years now, and I have made some truly excellent mistakes.&nbsp; Some of these mistakes have been downright embarrassing, but I have&nbsp;very few&nbsp;regrets.&nbsp; I have learned an awful lot.</p><p>We all screw something up from time to time, but we don't always learn from the experience.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Quite often, the reason we don't learn from a mistake is because we're too busy trying to hide it.</p><p>The best learning occurs when we choose to process&nbsp;a mistake with a mentor or peer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this goes against&nbsp;our natural tendency.&nbsp; When we foul something up, the last thing we want to do is shine a light on it so everyone can see what a bonehead we are.&nbsp; What we really want to do is cover it up and hope nobody notices.&nbsp; But in doing so we miss a huge opportunity to increase our cluefulness.</p><p>Sometimes we become so practiced at hiding mistakes that we learn to hide them from ourselves.&nbsp; When the daily build fails, what is your first reaction?&nbsp; Do you just assume that somebody else broke it?&nbsp;&nbsp;People with a positive L&nbsp;are more likely to&nbsp;immediately investigate to see if one of&nbsp;their checkins caused the problem.&nbsp; A posture of teachability means that you are quick to recognize your own mistakes and can confidently process them.</p><p>Bottom line, you can choose only one of the following options:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">  <p>A -- Manage your career.</p>  <p>B -- Manage others' perceptions of you.</p></blockquote><p>Choose A and your career&nbsp;will be outstanding.&nbsp; Choose B and your career will stagnate.</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Bug 5909</font></p><p>We recently had an opportunity to practice this discipline here at SourceGear.&nbsp; One of our best developers (let's call him Jeremiah) made a <em>really</em> big mistake.&nbsp; The coding error itself was small, a simple case of an if statement that wasn't quite right.&nbsp; But the potential effect of the bug was rather severe.</p><p>Jeremiah took full responsibility for cleaning up the mess.&nbsp; The actual bugfix was&nbsp;only the beginning.&nbsp; Jeremiah worked directly with each customer that might have been affected.&nbsp; He didn't stop to worry about whether anyone would think less of him for the mistake.&nbsp; In fact, he handled the situation so well that his perceived C is up, even though he never seemed to make that a goal of the experience.</p><p>In the end, we lost some time, but the major lasting effect of bug 5909 was increased cluefulness for Jeremiah.</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Risks</font></p><p>I am quite tempted to argue that an everyday posture of teachability is a lot cheaper than PDC.&nbsp; :-) </p><p>But to be fair, I'll have to admit that constant learning is a choice&nbsp;which involves risk.&nbsp; In two very important ways, choosing to have a high L will make you more vulnerable&nbsp;to your manager:</p><ul>  <li>The first big&nbsp;risk is the possibility that getting your mistakes out   in the open will mean that your manager will punish you for them.&nbsp; The   consequences here could vary broadly.&nbsp; Your manager might simply start   thinking you are an idiot.&nbsp; One of those mistakes might even get you   fired.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>The second risk is the possibility that your manager will become afraid of   you.&nbsp; Some managers really prefer to have a zero-derivative team.&nbsp;   Whether consciously or not, they&nbsp;stack their team&nbsp;with stagnant   people who are not likely to threaten their position.&nbsp; If   you&nbsp;are&nbsp;on just such a team and you suddenly become a "first   derivative developer", you are upsetting a very delicate balance.&nbsp; Your   manager may react unpredictably.&nbsp; You may be labeled a   troublemaker.&nbsp; He may even contrive some excuse to fire you.
</li>
</ul><p>Both of these risks are real, with&nbsp;consequences that can feel quite severe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on your personal circumstances, the sudden loss of a job can be a very distressing event.&nbsp; This is a valid concern, and I am trying not to flippantly dismiss it.</p><p>But you really don't want to work for this kind of a bozo anyway.&nbsp; In either of the situations above, it is time to be shopping for a new manager.&nbsp; This a basic axiom and a starting point for taking responsibility for your career:</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Don't work for a manager <br />
who is actively&nbsp;hindering <br />
your&nbsp;practice of&nbsp;<br />
constant learning.&nbsp; <br />
Just don't do it.</font></p><p>Corollary:&nbsp; Next time you're interviewing for a job, pretend that the power structure is reversed.&nbsp; The hiring manager is trying to figure out if there is any chance you are worthy of the job.&nbsp; Ignore that.&nbsp; Instead, spend your time trying to figure out if there is any chance that guy is worthy of being your manager.</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sansserif" size="4">Postscript</font></p><p>By the way, as long as you're going to develop a voracious appetite for knowledge, may I suggest that you not necessarily limit your scope to issues of coding and architecture?&nbsp; If you are in a <a href="/Small_ISV_Defined.html">small ISV</a>, or if your career goals include management, you may want to watch for opportunities to learn about <a href="/No_Programmers.html">other stuff</a>.&nbsp; Heck, you might even want to learn a thing or two about <a href="/Marketing_for_Geeks.html">marketing</a>. :-) </p>
