<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Law #19:  The Law of Failure</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">25 Jun 2004</span></p>
<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="/item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A

Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Failure says that "failure is to be expected and accepted".</P>
<P>Nothing interesting ever happens unless we take risks.&nbsp; The authors 
encourage an atmosphere of risk-taking with a good discussion of why individuals 
tend to be afraid of taking risks.</P>
<P>The chapter also includes another important point:&nbsp; <FONT 
face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"><STRONG>When you realize you've made a 
mistake, cut your losses.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>It's just so hard to admit a mistake.&nbsp; Denial is a wonderful thing.</P>
<P>In his <A href="/item_10161.html">book</A>, Barry 
Moltz busts the myth that persistence is the most important thing for an 
entrepreneur.&nbsp; Moltz claims that winners are people who know when to 
quit.</P>
<P>I completely agree.&nbsp; We need to give ourselves the freedom to take risks 
and try a lot of different things.&nbsp; But the obvious corollary here is that 
not all of those risks will work out.&nbsp; We need to learn to quickly 
recognize the ones that don't and take the appropriate action.</P>
<P>I could write lots of stuff about the topic of risk-taking, but I <A
