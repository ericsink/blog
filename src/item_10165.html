<p><span class="ArticleTitle">A brief personal boast</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">10 May 2004</span></p>
<P>My regular readers know that I usually confine my postings to&nbsp;the 
business of software and&nbsp;the occasional remark about the packaged cookie 
industry.&nbsp; Many weblogs are personal diaries of daily life.&nbsp; This one 
<EM>usually</EM> is not.&nbsp; But today I make an exception so that I 
can&nbsp;tell "the world" about a personal accomplishment.</P>
<P>This weekend I walked a <A 
href="http://www.500festival.com/">half-marathon</A>&nbsp;(13.1 miles).&nbsp; My 
time was 3 hours, 26 minutes, 15 seconds, for an average pace of 15:45 per 
mile.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the race a lot more than I thought I would.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 
over 30,000 participants.&nbsp; We started in downtown Indianapolis and went out 
to the speedway, walked one lap around the track, and then back downtown.&nbsp; 
I've never been a fan of auto racing, but this year I plan to watch the Indy 500 
simply because I walked the same track where they'll be driving.</P>
<P>The results are <A 
href="http://www.onlineraceresults.com/index.mini.php">online</A>, but 
unfortunately you won't see my name there.&nbsp; Approximately three hours after 
I started, the race was "red-flagged" due to the heat.&nbsp; If the weather gets 
too hot, they turn off the official clock in the hope that the remaining 
participants will not push themselves too hard.&nbsp; (Their concern was 
apparently quite valid -- I found out this morning that one man collapsed and <A 
href="http://www.indystar.com/articles/9/144885-5219-094.html">died</A> during 
the race.&nbsp; My condolences to his family.)&nbsp; Everyone who comes in after 
the red flag still gets a finisher's medal, but we didn't get an official 
time.&nbsp; Search on my last name and you will see that my wife (Lisa) and my 
Dad (Gary) both finished before the red flag.&nbsp; In addition, my Mom 
(Karolyn)&nbsp;finished the 5K.</P>
<P>I considered burying this announcement in an essay about the importance of 
finishing to the end of a long software development project.&nbsp; 
However,&nbsp;that particular veil would have been very thin indeed, so 
I'll&nbsp;just let this post be what it is.</P>
