<P>Are you one of those people who can make HTML pages look <EM>really</EM> 
good?</P>
<P>We've got some HTML-based applications in our current and future product 
mix.&nbsp; Our pages tend to look like a programmer tried really hard to make 
them look good.&nbsp; You know what I mean.&nbsp; We want them to look less 
<EM>dorky</EM>.&nbsp; In fact, we want these pages&nbsp;to be 
<EM>pretty</EM>.</P>
<P>To the extent possible, we like HTML which is&nbsp;minimal and clean.&nbsp; 
We don't want "pretty" if it will be achieved by excessive use of GIF images 
everywhere.</P>
<P>CSS is okay, as long as the resulting page looks good under IE 6 and the 
modern Mozilla variants.</P>
<P>This is not a staff position at SourceGear -- we're looking for a freelancer 
for a short-term gig.&nbsp; We will&nbsp;send you 2-3 ugly HTML pages.&nbsp; You 
send those pages back&nbsp;looking better.&nbsp; We'll run diff&nbsp;and apply 
your changes to the scripts which generate those pages.</P>
<P>If you are interested, please send me email.&nbsp; I would appreciate 
pointers to samples of your work, if possible.</P>
