With the recent announcement of Microsoft's Team Foundation Server (TFS), 
a lot of people are&nbsp;wondering about the future of SourceGear Vault. 
<P>On 24 May, I said <A href="item_10169.html">a 
few things</A> about this topic. In a nutshell, I claimed that SourceGear will 
be affected, but that we will be okay.&nbsp; I still believe that. 
<P>But as I expected, not everybody believes me. On Joel Spolsky's discussion 
board, somebody named "JT" recently <A 
href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=152765&amp;ixReplies=37">wrote</A>: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I've got a great deal of respect for Eric Sink and my heart sank 
  a little when I heard the news that MS was going to enter the source control 
  market because I knew this would be bad for Eric. (Regardless of what Eric 
  says, I think it will be far worse for him than what he is saying.)" 
</BLOCKQUOTE>First let me say that I take no offense at remarks like this.&nbsp; 
JT is entitled to his/her opinion.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no proof of my 
claims.&nbsp; Time will tell if I am right or wrong.&nbsp; 
<P>Nonetheless, I think I make myself less credible by not showing <B>both</B> 
sides of my feelings about this whole situation. If the only thing that you hear 
from me is a positive spin, you are not sure whether to believe me or not. One 
of the reasons that I write here in my weblog is that I want to be real, so I'd 
like to take a moment and provide some balance. 
<P>It is my understanding that the&nbsp;TFS team started serious development 
somewhere around the fall of 2002.&nbsp; Throughout the first half of 2003, we 
heard rumors about it.&nbsp; 
<P>In early September 2003, we got confirmation from Microsoft.&nbsp; Believe 
me, I was angry.&nbsp; I ranted and I vented.&nbsp; I used a few words my mother 
taught me not to use. 
<P>The scene of this announcement was weird.&nbsp; It was an NDA'd&nbsp;meeting 
of the VSIP program.&nbsp; All of the attendees were vendors of components or 
developers tools which integrate with Visual Studio.&nbsp; Standing in front of 
dozens of their so-called "partners", Microsoft staff put smiles on their faces 
and announced that they will be competing with&nbsp;almost all of us. 
<P>There was a lot of emotion in that room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every&nbsp;VSIP 
vendor&nbsp;had worked very hard to be a part of Microsoft's "ecosystem" for 
Visual Studio, only to end up feeling very betrayed.&nbsp; If this is how 
Microsoft treats its partners, how do they treat their enemies? 
<P>Incidentally, I thought the&nbsp;most interesting&nbsp;aspect of this meeting 
was watching the individuals who were part of Microsoft's VSIP team.&nbsp; As a 
system, Microsoft does not&nbsp;truly care about its ISVs, but many individual 
Microsoft employees really do.&nbsp; In fact, those people are exactly the sort 
of people who end up working in partner programs like VSIP.&nbsp; I felt some 
sympathy for these folks, as they were the ones who had to facilitate the 
delivery of the bad news. 
<P>Just a few days before this announcement, Chris Sells had asked me to write a 
monthly column for MSDN.&nbsp; When we heard that&nbsp;news from Microsoft, I 
nearly called Chris and told him where to stick&nbsp;his Longhorn Developer 
Center.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> 
<P>Instead, I calmed down and made a choice:&nbsp; I was angry, but I decided 
that I would not spend my life whining.&nbsp; My deadline was approaching, so I 
sat down and wrote my first MSDN column, <A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software10272003.asp">Whining 
by a Barrel of Rocks</A>. 
<P>My beliefs about SourceGear's future have not changed since I wrote that 
article.&nbsp; I said it then, and I will say it again now:&nbsp; Markets are 
not as "black-and-white" as we think. 
<P>Without competition from Microsoft, SourceGear was drooling at the 
possibility of annual revenue in the 8-figure range.&nbsp; (I consider that to 
be a heckuva a lot of money for a small ISV with no venture capital 
backing.)&nbsp; This outcome is no longer likely, but with some clever changes 
to strategy, SourceGear can still be very successful.&nbsp; Even with Microsoft 
in this market, we are going to continue having annual revenues of several 
million per year. 
<P>As the release of Visual Studio 2005 gets closer, more and more information 
will become available, and the world will begin to understand that TFS is not 
for everyone.&nbsp; Even now, details are <A 
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2004/06/16/157022.aspx">starting</A> 
to <A 
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2004/06/10/152609.aspx">appear</A>.&nbsp; 
I predict that TFS will be an outstanding product and a big success, but there 
will continue to be a lot of developers who want other choices, for one reason 
or another. 
<P>SourceGear will be here for those developers.&nbsp; Ever since September, we 
have been adapting our strategy.&nbsp; We have done and are continuing to do the 
things necessary to allow SourceGear to thrive.&nbsp; Our sales have continued 
to be extremely strong.&nbsp; Our customers continue to tell us how much they 
love our products. 
<P>Believe me. Don't believe me. Your choice. But I'm not going anywhere.

<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of Candor says that "when you admit a negative, the prospect will 
give you a positive".&nbsp; As usual, the examples from the book are mainstream 
consumer products:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Listerine did it when they acknowledged that their mouthwash tastes 
  terrible. 
  <LI>Avis did it when they acknowledged that they are #2. 
  <LI>Volkswagen did it when they acknowledged that the "bug" is ugly.</LI></UL>
<P>Each of these companies gained a lot when they applied the Law of 
Candor.&nbsp; People respect the courage and honesty it takes to admit that not 
everything is perfect.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Being Genuine</FONT></P>
<P>The Law of Candor is another one which is simply not intuitive.&nbsp; Most 
marcomm people are terrified of it.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom says that 
absolutely everything in your marketing message must be positive.&nbsp; In 
fact,&nbsp;a primary function of the marcomm team is to sanitize all public 
statements, ensuring that the company never says anything it does not want to 
say.</P>
<P>The rules of "marketing speak" are fairly well understood around the 
world.&nbsp; All marcomm teams speak this dialect as their first language, which 
means that all marketing teams sound basically the same.&nbsp; Almost every 
press release starts out with a bunch of mumbo jumbo that nobody ever 
reads:&nbsp; "Fiddlesticks Corporation, the leading provider of useless crapola, 
announced today that it&nbsp;is incorporating XML Web Services technology into 
its line of coffee mugs."&nbsp; </P>
<P>In 2004, it takes a very "special" kind of marketing person to actually 
believe that customers cannot see through this kind of spin.&nbsp; People today 
are being bombarded with so much advertising that traditional marketing is less 
effective than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanitized press releases are out.&nbsp; 
<A 
href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/20.html#a7831">Transparency</A> 
is in.&nbsp; Drowning in a sea of marketing mumbo jumbo, people admire companies 
that choose to be genuine.</P>
<P>An example from here at SourceGear:&nbsp; Most of our sales are "direct", but 
we do sell through a number of resellers as well.&nbsp; I don't usually think of 
our resellers as terribly strategic, since they account for a very small 
percentage of our sales.&nbsp; However, lately I find myself wondering why 
SourceGear doesn't sell through <A 
href="http://www.xtras.net/">Xtras.net</A>.&nbsp; Why am I wondering this?&nbsp; 
Because their CEO has a <A 
href="http://blogs.xtras.net/mikes/PermaLink,guid,daa1e487-18b5-4080-8141-536f600b0ab7.aspx">blog</A>, 
and a darn good one.&nbsp; I can't say that I agree with everything he says, but 
the fact remains:&nbsp; His choice to be genuine makes me <EM>want</EM> to do 
business with his company.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Credibility</FONT></P>
<P>Ignoring&nbsp;the Law of Candor can kill your credibility.&nbsp; Whatever 
your negative issue is, everybody already knows about it anyway.&nbsp; If you 
don't talk about it, then it will become "the elephant in the room".&nbsp; When 
you issue yet another sanitized press release, your customers eagerly read it, 
hoping to see some evidence that you have any self-awareness at all.&nbsp; They 
ask themselves, "Don't these people realize how awful their mouthwash 
tastes?"</P>
<P>As Ries and Trout say in the chapter, "Every negative statement you make 
about yourself is instantly accepted as truth.&nbsp; Positive statements, on the 
other hand, are looked at as dubious at best."</P>
<P>These dynamics are going on right now for me with respect to SourceGear 
Vault, our&nbsp;source control product.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, Microsoft 
announced Team Foundation Server, a really cool source control system which will 
be shipping sometime next year.&nbsp; It's not too hard to figure out that this 
announcement was not good news for SourceGear.</P>
<P>On the day of the Microsoft announcement, I posted some <A 
href="item_10169.html">remarks</A> about Team 
Foundation Server here on my weblog.&nbsp; While nothing on my blog is truly 
written in "marketing speak", this post was very positive, almost to the point 
of being sanitized.&nbsp; And not surprisingly, a lot of people didn't believe 
me when I said that SourceGear is going to be okay.</P>
<P>Well, it would be silly for me to write about the Law of Candor today without 
saying more on this topic.&nbsp; So, I've decided to "practice what I preach" by 
making some more remarks about <A 
href="item_10192.html">The Future of SourceGear 
Vault</A>.</P>
