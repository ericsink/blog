<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A 
href="item_10172.html">series</A> I am writing on 
</EM><A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667/sawdust08-20"><EM>The 22 
Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of the Category says that if you cannot be first in your category, 
setup a new category.&nbsp; This is really just another way of explaining a 
concept called "differentiation".</P>
<P>New entrepreneurs tend to think purely in terms of&nbsp;finding a product 
which is <STRONG>better</STRONG> than the&nbsp;competition.&nbsp; But so very 
often, it is more important to be <STRONG>different</STRONG> than to be 
better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every difference defines a category.&nbsp; And for each 
category, somebody is the leader.&nbsp; In other words, a large market is really 
just a cluster of small markets.&nbsp; Tackle the large market, and you will 
probably lose.&nbsp; Tackle&nbsp;a small market, and you&nbsp;might 
just&nbsp;win.</P>
<P>Don't think of&nbsp;MacOS as&nbsp;the number two desktop computing 
platform.&nbsp; Instead, think of them as the number one desktop computer in the 
graphic design category.&nbsp; The difference highlights the category in which 
Apple is number one.</P>
<P>Note that I am fully aware of the relative size of these two 
categories.&nbsp; Microsoft is number one in a category which is many times the 
size of the category in which Apple is number one.&nbsp; Finding a category in 
which Apple is number one is not an effort to claim equality.&nbsp; Rather, it 
simply explains who buys Macintosh and what differentiator is important to 
them.</P>
<P>The point of creating a category is to make sure you and your customers 
understand what your key differentiation is.&nbsp; What makes you 
different?&nbsp; To whom does that difference matter?&nbsp; In the minds of 
those people, <STRONG>you</STRONG> are number one.</P>
<P>But do make sure there are enough of those people.&nbsp; Every difference 
defines a category, but not every category matters.&nbsp; For example, suppose 
you want to create the number one IDE for programmers who develop enterprise 
accounting software in Forth.&nbsp; I daresay you won't encounter 
much&nbsp;opposition in your effort to win this category.&nbsp; However, you 
won't encounter much revenue there either.</P>
<P>Understanding categories has been critical for SourceGear&nbsp;as we 
do&nbsp;business in the source control market.&nbsp; People sometimes ask us how 
we can possibly sell source control tools when CVS is free.&nbsp; The reason is 
that "open source" is merely one category in the source control space.&nbsp; 
This market has quite a few categories, and the competition across 
those&nbsp;categories is minimal.&nbsp; If the customer wants a workflow-based 
tool,&nbsp;they only look at the tools in that category.&nbsp; If cross-platform 
support is critical,&nbsp;the customer isn't paying much attention to the 
Windows-centric products.</P>
<P>Perforce has played this game very well by setting up their own category 
called "<EM>fast</EM> source control tools".&nbsp; Speed is their 
differentiator, and they seem to be having a nice measure of success with this 
approach.</P>
<P>SourceGear Vault plays in the Windows-centric category of source control 
tools.&nbsp; I don't have data to prove it, but I'm pretty sure that right now 
we are number one with the collection of people who are using SourceSafe and 
want a painless transition to something better.&nbsp; We chose our category very 
specifically.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ries and Trout are right -- setup a category in which you can be first.&nbsp; 
But size does matter.&nbsp; Make sure the category you choose is not too large 
and not too small.</P>
