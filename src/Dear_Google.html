<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Dear Google, Please be careful.</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">11 May 2003</span></p>
<P>Dear Google,</P>
<P>Please be careful.</P>
<P>The rumor mill says you are thinking about removing weblogs from your main 
index.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us are&nbsp;concerned about 
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;like you.&nbsp;&nbsp;We visit you every day.&nbsp; But 
we want to remind you that your success has come because you consistently 
deliver what we want.&nbsp; So just in case it isn't obvious, here's what we 
want:</P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif><STRONG>As much as 
possible, <BR>we want you to <BR>show us the web without affecting it, 
and<BR>index the web without organizing it.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>It might help ease our concerns if you&nbsp;would tell us <EM>why</EM> you 
want to separate weblogs from other websites.&nbsp; For now, I can only 
speculate:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Perhaps you believe the quality of weblog content is a lower so it should 
  be searched separately? 
  <LI>Perhaps your indexing farm wasn't designed to handle tens of thousands of 
  sites which are updated on a quasi-daily basis? 
  <LI>Perhaps you are simply trying to provide a better search for weblogs, like 
  you did with catalogs, newsgroups, and newspapers? </LI></UL>
<P>I&nbsp;suppose I wouldn't mind having an index for weblogs only.&nbsp; In 
fact, I might appreciate the ability to search with results constrained only to 
weblogs.&nbsp; I already do this using <A 
href="http://www.rss-search.com/">rssSearch</A>.&nbsp; But I am more concerned 
about the notion of removing weblogs from your main index.&nbsp; When I search 
the whole web, why would I want to constrain my searches to exclude sites that 
you happen to call weblogs?</P>
<P>Regardless of your reasoning, I want to know how you will decide what is a 
weblog and what is not.&nbsp; It's not a trivial&nbsp;question.&nbsp; Do 
<EM>you</EM> have a perfect, unambiguous, black-and-white definition of a 
weblog?&nbsp; I don't.</P>
<P>How will you describe all the other sites that continue to remain in your 
main index?&nbsp; This isn't USENET with Deja.com, where the lines actually 
<EM>were</EM> "black and white".&nbsp; Weblogs are websites, and the boundaries 
around this particular subset are not always clear.&nbsp; How&nbsp;can a website 
manager&nbsp;predict which label you will apply to his/her site?</P>
<P>Here is my ten-part definition of a weblog:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>A weblog is a website. 
  <LI>The items in a weblog are <EM>usually</EM> presented in chronological 
  order. 
  <LI>A weblog is <EM>usually</EM> written by one individual in the first 
  person. 
  <LI>A weblog <EM>often</EM> posts links to other sites of interest to the 
  author. 
  <LI>A weblog <EM>usually</EM> has an RSS feed. 
  <LI>A weblog is <EM>usually</EM> updated regularly, daily or several times per 
  week. 
  <LI><EM>Some</EM> weblogs have places for readers to enter comments. 
  <LI><EM>Some</EM> weblogs have a blogroll. 
  <LI>A weblog <EM>usually</EM> lets the personality of its author show through. 

  <LI>A weblog <EM>usually</EM> contains content produced by an amateur writer, 
  not a professional.</LI></OL>
<P>Note that&nbsp;criterion #1 may be the only thing that all weblogs have in 
common.&nbsp; We all agree that weblogs are websites.&nbsp; After that, things 
turn gray very quickly.&nbsp; All of the other nine criteria include a fuzzy 
word like "usually".&nbsp; I can't imagine using these ten things to draw 
meaningful boundaries.&nbsp; Exceptions are easy to find.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>For starters, I assert that <A href="">my own 
  site</A> is a weblog, although I don't update it every day, I don't support 
  comments, and I don't have a blogroll. 
  <LI>Is <A href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</A> a weblog?&nbsp; 
  Obviously.&nbsp; What about <A 
  href="http://davenet.userland.com/">DaveNet</A>? 
  <LI>Is <A href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Log</A> a weblog?&nbsp; Surely, 
  yes, but it's not written by one individual. 
  <LI>We all agree <A 
  href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan Gilmour's 
  site</A> is a weblog, right?&nbsp; But he's not an amateur writer.&nbsp; Would 
  you make an exception for him? 
  <LI>Is <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel On Software</A> a 
  weblog?&nbsp; I think so, but the quality of content there is unusually high, 
  including the complete text of a published book and enough stuff to produce 
  two or three more.&nbsp; If you're going to filter websites by quality of 
  content, surely you're going to make an exception for Joel, right?&nbsp; Who 
  else has content which is just good enough for the main index? 
  <LI>Is <A href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/">Cafe Au Lait</A> a weblog?&nbsp; 
  It looks like one to me, but it has no RSS feed. 
  <LI>Is <A href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> a weblog?&nbsp; I don't 
  think so, but some people do.&nbsp; It is listed&nbsp;on <A 
  href="http://www.weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</A>. 
  <LI>To be fair, I'll confess I can't find a weblog which fails criterion #2 
  above.&nbsp; It seems&nbsp;that all weblogs&nbsp;present&nbsp;their items in 
  chronological order.&nbsp; Perhaps criteria 1 and 2 are the real definition of 
  a weblog.&nbsp; So, that means&nbsp;<A href="http://www.msnbc.com/">MSNBC</A> 
  is a weblog, right?&nbsp; 
  <LI>Is <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</A> a weblog because it has 
  RSS feeds? 
  <LI>Is the home page of the <A href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</A> project 
  a weblog?&nbsp; Its items are presented in chronological order, and it 
  supports an RSS feed. 
  <LI>If a corporate site were to change its format, showing daily news about 
  the company's products, in chronological order, with an RSS feed, would it 
  become a weblog?</LI></UL>
<P>Thanks for recognizing that weblogs are interesting.&nbsp; In many ways, the 
web is simply a new medium for old things, but weblogs are actually new.&nbsp; 
Nothing like them has ever existed before.&nbsp; Weblogs are one of the few 
areas where the web is a voice rather than an echo.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Please be careful.</P>
