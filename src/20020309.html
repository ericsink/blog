I suppose <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-855696.html">this</a> kind of thing was inevitable, but it's no fun.  Life is so valuable that it's important to make each day count.  Do the execs at Sun really want to spend their days making lawsuits instead of making great workstations, servers, and platforms?<br><br>It takes the fun out of Microsoft too.  For eight years now, my job has periodically involved direct communication with various people at Microsoft.  Over those years, something changed.  The Microsoft persona of 2002 is very different than it was in 1995.  Pushiness and passion seems to have been replaced with coldness and caution.  I don't work there, but I suspect that becoming a monopoly has taken the fun out being a Microsoft employee.  I know that it has diminished the fun of working with them.<br><br>
Perhaps I should give Sun's management the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe they would really prefer to spend their time making Java better, but they feel compelled to file this lawsuit because of obligation to their shareholders.  It's easier for me to believe that Sun's shareholders are the ones who care only about money.  But it still feels like we are becoming an industry that creates legal work instead of creating insanely great products.
