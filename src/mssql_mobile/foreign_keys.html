teaser: SQLite has excellent support for foreign keys, including the ability to defer them until commit time, which I wish that SQL Server could do.

<h2>I can't use SQLite!  It doesn't support foreign keys!</h2>

<p>Actually, it does.  Since version 3.6.19, released in October 2009.  Before
the first iPad.  Windows 7 was not quite out yet.
Miley Cyrus was still Hannah Montana.</p>

<h2>You're wrong!  This code should fail but doesn't!</h2>

<pre class="screen">
CREATE TABLE [to] (pk int PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE TABLE [from] (other REFERENCES [to](pk) );
INSERT INTO [from] (other) VALUES (3);
</pre>

<p>Fair enough.  It is easy to get the impression that SQLite still lacks
support for foreign keys because the feature is [usually] turned off by default, to preserve
backward compatibility.</p>

<h2>How to turn SQLite foreign key support on</h2>

<p>To enable the enforcement of foreign key constraints, execute the following SQL statement, shortly
after you open your SQLite database connection:</p>

<pre class="screen">
PRAGMA foreign_keys = 1;
</pre>

<p>I <i>always</i> use SQLite with foreign keys.  In fact, I always open SQLite
connections with a helper function
which (1) opens the SQLite connection and (2) immediately executes the PRAGMA
above.</p>

<h2>Differences</h2>

<p>Once you've got the feature turned on, foreign key support in SQLite is generally
similar to what a SQL Server dev would expect.  Full documentation is available <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html">on the SQLite website</a>, but there are a few things worth highlighting.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>SQLite supports simple foreign keys (with one column referencing one
    column), or composite foreign keys (with multiple columns referencing
    multiple columns).</p></li>

    <li><p>SQLite does support ON DELETE and ON CASCADE.</p></li>

    <li><p>SQLite allows a foreign key constraint to be <i>deferred</i>, which
    means that its enforcement is postponed until the transaction is committed.
    This is a handy feature that I really wish SQL Server had.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Shameless, blatantly self-serving commercial remark</h2>

<p><a href="http://zumero.com/dev-center/zss/">Zumero for SQL Server</a> automatically syncs foreign key constraints.  Microsoft <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sync/bb736753.aspx">Sync Framework</a> does not.</p>

<p>So there.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
<tt>PRAGMA foreign_keys = 1;</tt>
Always.
