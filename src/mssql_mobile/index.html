<h2>Stuff not written yet</h2>
<UL>
<li><p>(not written yet) Community</p></li><blockquote>The SQLite community, insofar as such a thing exists, is going to seem very different from the .NET community where you live now.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Visual Studio</p></li><blockquote>People have done some things to make using SQLite with Visual Studio a more pleasant experience.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) System.Data.SQLite</p></li><blockquote>The SQLite team supports an ADO.NET-compatible API.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) SQLite-Net</p></li><blockquote>SQLite-Net is a popular SQLite wrapper for C#, including a simple ORM.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Encryption</p></li><blockquote>Keeping data on a mobile device is a risk, brecause people lose their phones and tablets.  A SQLite database file can be encrypted using the SQLite Encryption Extension ($) or SQLCipher (open source, but official/supported builds from Zetetic are $).</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Language</p></li><blockquote>The most jarring part of the transition to mobile app development is changing from C# to Objective-C or Java.  Xamarin's tools can help with that.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Cars and Clocks</p></li><blockquote>I won't apologize for my claim that you will be better off if you understand how things work 'under the hood'.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) API</p></li><blockquote>SQLite's primary API is in C, which is not the natural language for someone coming from the .NET world, nor is it the natural language for developing on mobile platforms.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Locks</p></li><blockquote>More than anything else, the reason for the word Lite in SQLite is because of the simpler way it handles locking.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Collations</p></li><blockquote>SQLite supports several built-in collations, plus the ability to define new ones.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) uniqueidentifier</p></li><blockquote>SQLite doesn't have a uniqueidentifier type, but it does have ways of dealing with them.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) IDENTITY</p></li><blockquote>The equivalent of IDENTITY in SQLite is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, which, believe it or not, is different from INT PRIMARY KEY.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Blobs</p></li><blockquote>SQLite has excellent support for blobs.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Dates and Times</p></li><blockquote>SQLite has no specific types for dates or times, but it has a number of functions for dealing with them in textual or numeric format.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Indexes</p></li><blockquote>SQLite supports indexes, with generally fewer limitations than SQL Server.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Triggers</p></li><blockquote>SQLite's support for triggers is surprisingly strong, but there are significant differences from SQL Server.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Views</p></li><blockquote>SQLite has basic support for views, but they are read-only.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Joins</p></li><blockquote>SQLite supports inner join and left outer join.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Common Table Expressions</p></li><blockquote>As of version 3.8.3, SQLite supports common table expressions and recursive queries.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) ALTER TABLE</p></li><blockquote>SQLite's support for ALTER TABLE is very limited.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Temporary tables</p></li><blockquote>SQLite has good support for temporary tables.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) SELECT INTO</p></li><blockquote>SQLite can create a temp table from a SELECT result, but the syntax is different.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) MERGE</p></li><blockquote>SQLite does not support the MERGE statement, but it does have some similar features which will cover many related use cases.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Control Structures</p></li><blockquote>SQLite doesn't support T-SQL stuff like conditionals or loops, but it has workarounds for some common cases.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) PRAGMA</p></li><blockquote>SQLite's PRAGMA statement is a way to access all kinds of configuration settings that are specific to SQLite.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) EXPLAIN</p></li><blockquote>SQLite's EXPLAIN statement can show you what its query planner intends to do.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Full Text Search</p></li><blockquote>SQLite includes an excellent full text search engine.</blockquote>
<li><p>(not written yet) Performance</p></li><blockquote>In many cases, SQLite is significantly faster than SQL Server.  But not always.</blockquote></UL><p>&nbsp;</p>
