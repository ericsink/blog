<h2>A Wave of Change</h2>

<p>More and more of the world's "computers" are actually mobile devices.
Perhaps you've noticed.  <tt><b>:-)</b></tt></p>

<p>As of February 2014, this trend is huge and still accelerating.  
Benedict Evans recently <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/2/12/apple-passes-microsoft">pointed out</a> 
that Apple sold more iOS devices in Q4 2013 than the number of Windows PCs
sold globally: "mobile is the next computing platform and it's a lot bigger
than PCs in unit sales, so even the smaller player can overtake the total PC
business".</p>

<p>Remember back around 2005 when we started writing all our clients
to run inside a web browser?  It was a great disturbance in the industry,
as if millions of desktop GUI toolkits
suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.</p>

<p>This mobile wave feels even bigger than that.</p>

<p>And it's happening, whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Suppose you are an enterprise CIO.  Maybe you don't <i>want</i> everybody
switching to mobile.  Maybe you don't <i>like</i> this Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) thing,
which forces you to deal
with security and compatibility and deployment issues for dozens of different
mobile devices chosen at the whims of your fickle coworkers.</p>

<p>But that's just how it is.</p>

<p>It is hard to overstate just how big this wave of change is.  Some of us will
be unaffected, but not many.</p>

<h2>However...</h2>

<p>One thing that is NOT going away is SQL.</p>

<h2>What?!?  I heard SQL was dying.</h2>

<p>I have nothing against the NoSQL world and I have no interest in this
religious war.  Couchbase.  Cassandra.  Hadoop.  There's a lot of cool and
interesting stuff going on.</p>

<p>But all that stuff exists on a planet where the following things are also true:</p>

<ul>
    
<li><p>The vast majority of data in the business world is in some kind of SQL
database.</p></li>

<li><p>Worldwide investment in SQL-related technologies is in the hundreds of
billions of dollars.  And I may be understating that.</p></li>

<li><p>The business world makes sweeping technology changes much more slowly
than the consumer world.  Your bank still runs on COBOL.  IBM mostly sells things
that people think are dead, and they still have more revenue than Google.</p></li>

<li><p>Switching a large system from SQL to anything NoSQL-ish is a non-smooth
transition.  The paradigm is very different.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Most new software projects are not greenfield.  Most
new code
has a requirement to integrate with something else that already exists.</p>

<p>Your IT department is simply NOT going to deal with the mobile wave by
rewriting everything on Mongo.  They're not going to give up constraints and
ACID and foreign keys.  They're not going to rewrite all their queries with
map/reduce.  They're not going to discard a mountain of established code and tooling
and expertise.  It's just not gonna happen.</p>

<p>NoSQL has its place.  But SQL will not disappear during your lifetime.</p>

<h2>But there's still that wave...</h2>

<p>Your business data is in SQL.  Your users are trading in their PCs for
smartphones and tablets.  If it hasn't happened already, you are going to be
asked to let them view/edit that data on their mobile devices.</p>

<p>If you want to create a mobile app, 
you've got two main options for how that app can
interact with data on the backend:</p>

<ol>

    <li>
    <p>
    Remote procedure calls:  Keep a live network
    connection to the server and do all your database CRUD operations over 
    something like a REST API.
    </p>
    <p>
    (See also:  "web services")
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    Replicate and sync:  Keep a
    [partial] copy of the data from the server and do all your database CRUD
    operations locally on the mobile device, synchronizing changes in both
    directions when the network is available.
    </p>
    <p>
    (See also:  "occasionally connected", "offline first")
    </p>
    </li>

</ol>

<p>Or some combination of the two.</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to both of these two approaches.  
Each of them is popular for different reasons.
But my primary area of interest is in the situations where you want
to do at least some of your database operations on the device without a
network involved.</p>

<p>And if you want to deal with [some of] your data on the device, you
probably want to use SQL on that device, right?  Especially if you want to
port some existing code.</p>

<h2>SQL on mobile devices</h2>

<p>The bad news:  SQL Server Compact won't help you anymore.  It is being left behind
as Microsoft moves ahead with a mobile strategy built on WinRT.  And the world
is cross-platform now anyway.  Even if Microsoft decides to renew its
commitment to a compact edition of SQL Server for its own mobile OS, it is not
likely they will support the same solution on iOS or Android.</p>

<p>The good news:  SQLite (<a href="http://sqlite.org/">sqlite.org</a>) is an outstanding small implementation
of SQL.  It is open source and supported on all mobile platforms.
In fact, over a billion mobile devices currently have SQLite preinstalled.  It is
ubiquitous, reliable, and far more capable than the word "Lite" would seem
to imply.  Microsoft apparently considers SQLite to be the replacement for SQL
CE.  If, for whatever reason, you want to use SQL on a mobile device, then
SQLite is [almost certainly] your best choice.</p>

<h2>About this series of articles</h2>

<p>I'm writing about using SQLite when developing mobile apps.  And my target
audience is folks who are coming from the world of SQL Server and .NET.</p>

<p>There are differences.  There is a learning curve.  Hopefully this series of
articles will help.</p>

<p>Most of the entries will be fairly short and focused on a specific issue.</p>

<h2>This is [mostly] not a product pitch</h2>

<p>My goal in this series is to make it useful for people whether they use my
product or not.</p>

<p>But it's only fair to disclose this right up front:  My company makes a
product called <a href="http://zumero.com/dev-center/zss/">Zumero for SQL Server</a>, which is designed to synchronize data
between SQL Server on the backend and SQLite on a mobile device.</p>

<p>But these articles are not Zumero-specific.  Maybe you're doing sync with
Microsoft Sync Framework.  Or maybe your sync needs are simple and you're just
writing it yourself.  Or maybe you're not actually doing sync at all.</p>

<p>Whatever.  If you are coming from a SQLServer/.NET background and want to know about using
SQLite on mobile, I hope you find value in what I'm writing.</p>

<p>(Zumero is relevant to the topic at hand, so I'm sure I'll end up mentioning
it.  When I do, I'll try to be obvious about it so you can skip those parts if
you want.)</p>
