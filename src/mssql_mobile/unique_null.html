teaser: SQL Server treats NULL as a value. SQLite treats it as the absence of a value.

<h2>Nullable columns in UNIQUE constraints</h2>

<p>The following code will cause a unique constraint violation in SQL Server:</p>

<pre class="screen">
CREATE TABLE foo (pk int PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY, x int UNIQUE NULL);
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (2);
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (NULL);
</pre>

<p>SQL Server doesn't allow the second NULL value to be inserted for column
[x].</p>

<p>But SQLite allows this.  See <a href="/mssql_mobile/sync_and_constraints.html">Issues with sync and constraints</a> for more
discussion of why this kind of thing matters.</p>

<h2>Boxes and Cats</h2>

<p>The difference arises from the question of whether NULL is considered a value or the absence of a value.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="/mssql_mobile/box_cat.jpg"/>Suppose you have a set of
cardboard boxes.  Each box can hold one cat.  And the cats must be unique.</p>

<p>SQLite thinks of NULL as an empty box.  Having multiple empty boxes does not
violate the rule about cats being unique.</p>

<p>SQL Server thinks of NULL as the name of a specific cat.  A box cannot be empty.  And the NULL cat can only be in one box.</p>

<p>If you prefer an explanation with more technical detail and fewer cat
pictures, see <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/nulls.html">this page</a> on the
SQLite website, which (at the time of this writing)
provides a chart of how 12 different SQL implementations handle 8 different
situations with NULL values.  An additional remark about the
amibiguous language in the SQL92 standard appears in the <a href="https://sqlite.org/faq.html">SQLite FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Solution 1:  Don't have the problem</h2>

<p>One possible solution is to never have this problem in the first place.  Obviously, this issue
won't arise if you don't have any nullable columns in unique constraints.</p>

<h2>Solution 2:  Don't cause the problem</h2>

<p>Another option is to just not have any bugs in your app.  <b><tt>:-)</tt></b></p>

<p>Hmmm.  That was a bit too flippant to be helpful.  Let me try to explain it a different way:</p>

<p>In many (or most?) situations, SQL constraints are used as a way to prevent bugs in upper
layers from screwing up the data.  In other words, if a constraint gets violated, that's
a sign that something went wrong.  A constraint violation is typically <i>not</i> used
as control flow of the software under normal usage.  So, if a constraint violation
happens, it is usually a sign of a bug in an upper layer.</p>

<p>SQL constraints also provide guarantees which allow the code in upper layers to be
simpler.  Those guarantees are part of the contractual agreement between your application
code and your database.  If the database is promising that values in column [foo] will 
never be greater than 5, the application code can trust in that promise.  It doesn't
need to do range checking on every value it gets from the database.</p>

<p>If SQL constraints did not exist, we would simply have to enforce our data integrity
rules in application code instead of at the database level.  This is not "The SQL Way", but it is
certainly possible.  The NoSQL folks have to live this way all the time.</p>

<p>So, you have the option of simply accepting
the fact that SQLite will not enforce SQL Server's rule about distinct NULLs.
If your app never inserts a NULL into that column, you don't need to worry about it.
Or you can make your application code do extra checking to make sure.</p>

<h2>Solution 3:  Use a trigger to make SQLite act like SQL Server</h2>

<p>If you want SQLite to enforce distinct NULLs at the database level in the same
way as SQL Server does, you can get that behavior by adding triggers to your SQLite
tables.  For example:</p>

<pre class="screen">
CREATE TRIGGER "uniqnull" BEFORE INSERT ON "foo" WHEN ( (NEW."x" IS NULL) )
BEGIN

SELECT RAISE(ABORT, 'constraint violation: unique null')
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM "foo" c WHERE ( (c."x" IS NEW."x") ));

END
</pre>

<p>The syntax of this trigger probably looks strange to you.  I'll be writing about
the differences between SQL Server triggers and SQLite triggers in another entry
in this series.</p>

<p>This trigger will impact performance.  You can decide if the tradeoff is worth
it for your application.  Measure it.</p>  

<p>(When <a href="http://zumero.com/dev-center/zss/">Zumero for SQL Server</a> encounters a nullable column in a unique
constraint, it automatically adds triggers like this one to the corresponding SQLite table on
the client side.  Those triggers include a comment about possible
performance impact and suggesting that the trigger can simply be dropped if the
other tradeoff is preferable.)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>SQLite handles nullable columns in unique constraints differently from SQL Server.  
This distinction may never cause you problems, but if it does, you have several
options for dealing with it.</p>
