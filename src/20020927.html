Well, this has become my least-frequently-updated weblog.  We've been very "heads-down" at SourceGear for most of 2002, building our <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">new product</a>.  We'll be more externally focused next year after the product is shipping.  In the meantime, I keep discovering that I don't have a lot to say to the world about technology and business.
But I <b>will</b> say:  <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> is just so very cool.
Oh yeah, one other tidbit:  My personal web/email server now has 416 days of uptime.  Yes, it's a Linux machine and gosh aren't we all really impressed with the stability of Linux and yadda yadda yadda.<br><br>
What's truly amazing about my machine's uptime is not the OS -- it's the fact that this machine is NOT on an uninterruptible power supply.   :-)
