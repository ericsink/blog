title: SourceGear / Ximian Deal
---

<P>We're <A 
href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear">announcing</A> 
a deal with <A href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian</A> today.&nbsp; We need 
Unix clients for <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear 
Vault</A>, but alas, C# has no real cross-platform story.&nbsp; So we've agreed 
to give Ximian a bag of money and they've agreed to hack <A 
href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</A>&nbsp;and make it speak .NET XML Web 
Services to ASP.NET.&nbsp; Vault users will be able to run our command-line 
client on Linux, speaking to the Vault server, which will continue to&nbsp;be 
Windows-only.</P>
<P>(Note that we are punting the cross-platform GUI issues for now.&nbsp; The 
Vault GUI client uses Windows Forms.&nbsp; We'll tackle non-Windows GUI clients 
after we get the basic stuff working well.)</P>
<P>It's easy to feel good about this kind of deal, and not just because it's an 
honor to work with Miguel de Icaza.&nbsp; Everybody gets 
something.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vault users&nbsp;get more flexibility.&nbsp; Ximian gets 
revenue.&nbsp; All Mono users get interop with .NET XML Web Services.&nbsp; The 
world is a [slightly] better place.&nbsp;<img src="/smiley.gif"></P>
