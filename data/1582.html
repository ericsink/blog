 <li >So I'll confess I was feeling a little smug earlier this
     week when CMP announced that they were dissolving Software Development
     magazine just four days after I posted my <a
     href="{{{link:id='1581'}}}">bit</a> about the
     increasing irrelevance of such publications.&nbsp; What I didn't say in my rant
     is how saddened I am by these indications that an era is ending.&nbsp; I <i>like</i>
     developer magazines.&nbsp; I published my first article before I had a drivers
     license.&nbsp; I'm going to miss them.&nbsp; I suppose it's more accurate to say
     that I already miss them.</li>
 <li >My book is finally real.&nbsp; I received the first copies
     yesterday.&nbsp; I'm not sure when it will show up in bookstores, but I'm
     guessing fairly soon.</li>

     doesn't really count as me getting Slashdotted, but kinda.</li>
