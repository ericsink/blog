<p>During the month of May 2006, we conducted an experiment
with the coupon code feature of our online store.&nbsp; On May 1<sup>st</sup>, I
posted a coupon code <a href="{{{link:id='1590'}}}">here
on my blog</a>.&nbsp; The coupon was good for a 20% discount during the month of
May.&nbsp; Now I am ready to report the results of the experiment.</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >During the month of May, the coupon code was used for 9.5%
     of the transactions processed through the SourceGear store. <br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Most of the coupon transactions were significantly smaller
     than the average size of the transactions for the month as a whole.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >31% of the coupon transactions came from outside the United States.&nbsp; For the month as a whole, 34% of the transactions came from outside the United States.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >All of the coupon transactions used a credit card as the
     method of payment.&nbsp; For the month as a whole, 23% of the transactions were
     paid with a purchase order, but none of them used the coupon.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I selected 25 of the coupon users and asked them how the
     coupon affected their purchasing decision:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li >4 people did not respond to the question.</li>
  <li >5 people said that the coupon swung their decision toward
      Vault.&nbsp; They were undecided about their Vault purchase, and the coupon
      affected their decision.&nbsp; Note also:&nbsp; The average size of those 5 transactions
      was dramatically less than the average transaction size for the month as
      a whole.</li>
  <li >3 people said they were already planning to buy our
      product, but the coupon prompted them to do it sooner than they had
      planned.</li>
  <li >1 person said the coupon caused them to buy more licenses
      than they had planned.</li>
  <li >12 people said the coupon did not affect their decision
      in any way.&nbsp; They were already planning to make a purchase at full price,
      but they found the coupon, so they used it.&nbsp; (Of those 12 people, 3 of
      them volunteered that they simply Googled for the coupon code when they
      saw the place for it on the order form.&nbsp; This is consistent with
      indications from the Apache log files on my blog server.)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>The Observations and Conclusions</h3>

<h5>Positives and Negatives</h5>

<p>Looking at the customers who responded to my question, I see
several positives:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >5 people said that the coupon swung their decision toward
     Vault.&nbsp; These are customers we would not have gained.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >1 person said the coupon caused them buy more licenses
     than they had planned.&nbsp; <br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >3 people said they were already planning to buy our
     product, but the coupon caused them to do it sooner than they had
     planned.&nbsp; A pessimist might say that this is a bad thing, since we would
     have gotten full price from these people later.&nbsp; I think this is a good
     thing because even if they planned to buy later, they might have ended up
     changing their mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, 12 people said the coupon did not affect their
decision.&nbsp; They were planning to make a purchase at full price, but they were
able to pay less because they found the coupon.&nbsp; An optimist could find
positive things to say about those 12 transactions.&nbsp; After all, we don't want
to be in the habit of complaining when we people trade us cash for our
software.</p>

<p>But the fact is that these 12 transactions can also be seen
in a negative light.&nbsp; Those customers paid 20% less than they were willing to
pay.&nbsp; The aggregate amount saved by those customers is effectively a cost of
having the coupon.</p>

<p>A rather simplistic judgment of the coupon experiment would
be to add up an estimate of the incremental revenue produced by the coupon and
subtract the total amount saved by the 12 folks who would have been willing to
pay full price.&nbsp; (I'm sure there are several reasons why this analysis is
simplistic, but the first one that comes to mind is that it ignores the future
positive effects of having 5 customers we would not otherwise have.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not disclosing actual revenue numbers here, but
I will say this:&nbsp; It appears that the net revenue from this coupon experiment
was positive, but it was not a very large number.&nbsp; (Keep in mind that I only
asked for feedback from 25 of the coupon customers, and only 21 of them
replied.)</p>

<h5>Measuring Reach</h5>

<p>One interesting way to use coupon codes is to track the
effectiveness and reach of an advertisement.&nbsp; For example, we might put a
coupon code in a print ad and then watch how many times the coupon gets used.&nbsp;
This would give us some sort of indication of the effectiveness of that ad.</p>

<p>In this case, the coupon appeared in a blog entry, not in a
print ad.&nbsp; Can we look at the data from this experiment and draw any
conclusions about the reach and effectiveness of my blog?&nbsp; I'm not sure, but it
seems like I would be extrapolating from very little data.&nbsp; I'll predict that
if we place a coupon in a print ad, it will show up in less than 9.5% of our
transactions.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the 9.5% number seemed kind of low to me.&nbsp; Think of
it this way:&nbsp; Over 90% of our customers in May could have saved money on their
purchase if they were reading my blog.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>For now, I will decline to draw any solid conclusions on
this issue.&nbsp; The 9.5% number may end up being useful for comparisons later.</p>

<h5>Segmenting the Market</h5>

<p>Traditional coupons are a way of charging lower prices to
customers who are more price-sensitive.&nbsp; Joel Spolsky explains this concept
rather well in his article on <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">pricing</a>.&nbsp;
I summarize it like this:&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Grocery store coupons are a form of
market segmentation.&nbsp; People who are willing to take the time to clip coupons
from the Sunday newspaper inserts are rewarded for their efforts with discounted
prices.&nbsp; The value of the coupons (the amount of the discount) is specifically
tuned to ensure that the time spent clipping them is worth approximately
minimum wage.&nbsp; Most affluent customers eventually realize that clipping
coupons is a very low-paying job, so they stop doing it.&nbsp; Therefore, the
groceries get sold to two different groups of people at two different prices, and
the "consumer surplus" is captured.</p>

<p>Obviously, some of our customers are more price-sensitive
than others.&nbsp; It makes sense that our coupon would be appealing to the more
price-sensitive folks in our customer base.&nbsp; Some of the data from our
experiment seems consistent with this:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Most of the coupon transactions were significantly smaller
     than the average size of the transactions for the month as a whole.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Looking at the 5 people who said the coupon swung their
     decision, all of them spent dramatically less than our average customer
     spends.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Nobody who used a coupon paid with a purchase order.&nbsp;
     Purchase orders are more commonly used in larger companies with purchasing
     departments, which we can assume are likely to be somewhat less
     price-sensitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>But one piece of data suggests that if our coupon was an
attempt at market segmentation, it failed miserably:&nbsp; 12 out of 25 people
questioned used the coupon to get a discount even though they would have been willing
to pay full price.&nbsp; Why did this happen?</p>

<p>I observe that the coupon on my blog was simply far too easy
to find.&nbsp; Just Google for "SourceGear coupon code" and it shows up as the
second result.&nbsp; If we want to decrease the percentage of people who used the
coupon simply because they saw it, we need to add more hassle.&nbsp; The grocery
store example suggests that a relatively small amount of tedium will be an
effective obstacle.&nbsp; Clipping coupons from the Sunday newspaper isn't really
that difficult, but lots of people just don't bother.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>The transparency in this note is, well, atypical.&nbsp; I am
writing this because I think people might find it interesting, but I am taking
somewhat of a risk.&nbsp; I hope that nothing I have written here causes offense to
any of our customers.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>If you are reading this and you happen to be one of our more
"price-sensitive" customers, please know that we appreciate your business.&nbsp; I
feel humbled by <i>every</i> customer who chooses our products, from the small
shop with one license to the large enterprise with hundreds of seats. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, if you are one of the coupon customers who responded
to my question, thank you again for taking the time to provide useful
information.</p>

<p>I think this coupon experiment was interesting.&nbsp; It's over
for now, and there are currently no valid coupon codes in the SourceGear
store.&nbsp; But I think we'll probably try this concept again sometime in the
future.&nbsp; As I've hinted here, I want to see what kind of different results we
might get by placing a coupon code someplace other than here on my blog.</p>
