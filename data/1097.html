<p>Actually it will take a few months for the space to be remodeled, so we're not moving right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it's official now.&nbsp; We signed the lease today for new office space.&nbsp; Sometime this fall, SourceGear will be relocating to the fourth floor of a classy old building in downtown Champaign, just down the street from <a href="http://www.volition-inc.com/">Volition</a> and just one mile from the <a href="http://siebelcenter.cs.uiuc.edu/">world's smartest building</a>.</p>
<p>We're really excited.&nbsp; The new space is currently an empty shell but it's going to be set up just the way we want it, including a server room with extra cooling and special room for our pool table.&nbsp; Every employee will have a private office with a window looking out over the downtown area.&nbsp; Within a two block radius, we'll have a great selection of restaurants and coffee shops as well as a park.</p>
<p>I dread the actual move, but I'm <em>so</em> eager to start settling into our new location.</p>
