<P><EM>(This entry is part of a <A

Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of&nbsp;the Opposite says that the #2 player should generally do the 
opposite of what the #1 player is doing.</P>
<P>If you are #2 in your category, you want to be #1, right?</P>
<P>Wrong.&nbsp; You can't choose to be #1, but you can certainly choose to be #3 
or #4.&nbsp; The worst thing you can do is to try and beat the #1 player&nbsp;at 
his own game.&nbsp; Instead, realize that not everyone in the market wants to 
play that game.&nbsp; Offer those people an alternative.</P>
<P>This law is the reason that I humbly assert that Borland's strategy for 
Delphi is all wrong.</P>
<P>For several&nbsp;years, Delphi had been doing a fine job playing Pepsi to 
Visual Basic's portrayal of Coke.&nbsp; Delphi is a solid #2 in the market for 
RAD tools.&nbsp; People <STRONG>like</STRONG> Delphi.&nbsp; It's a highly 
respected tool.</P>
<P>But something has gone terribly wrong.&nbsp; When Microsoft zigged, Delphi 
should have zagged.</P>
<P>VB.NET is a huge discontinuous change from Visual Basic 6.&nbsp; Even now, 
around two years later, some VB developers are still mad.&nbsp; Not everyone 
<STRONG>wants</STRONG> to move onto the new .NET platform.&nbsp; Some people 
need to continue developing traditional Win32 applications for&nbsp;quite a 
while&nbsp;longer.</P>
<P>I'm not saying that those angry VB6 people would have moved to Delphi.&nbsp; 
But the Law of the Opposite still applies here.&nbsp; Borland should have 
immediately shifted its message to be the opposite of the leader:&nbsp; "Delphi 
-- the Win32 RAD tool that isn't trying to force you into something you don't 
want to do."&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>(Yes, yes, I know that Delphi 9 will still have support for native Win32 
targets.&nbsp; The point remains:&nbsp; Borland is weakening itself and its 
message by refusing to focus.)</P>
<P>Interestingly, Borland seems to have repeated this mistake throughout their 
product line.&nbsp; The result is that I can't figure out what market position 
they are trying to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Borland a&nbsp;.NET company or a Java 
company?</P>
<P>Luckily, although their marketing <STRONG>strategy</STRONG> team is MIA, 
their marketing <STRONG>communications</STRONG> team has saved the day by coming 
up with "Excellence Endures".&nbsp; Surely a great tagline will take care of all 
their problems, eh?&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
