<p>So are there any SOAP gurus out there among my regular readers?&nbsp; I have a question about the current status of SOAP interop.</p>
<p>The SourceGear Vault server is an ASP.NET Web Service.&nbsp; People want the ability to communicate with Vault from a fairly wide variety of platforms.&nbsp; Are there any non-Microsoft implementations of SOAP or Web Services which can painlessly talk to ASP.NET's implementation?</p>
<p>Whenever I visit the SOAP-related websites, I see lots of evidence that all the SOAP implementors are carefully testing for compliance with specs and test suites.&nbsp; I admire this level of discipline, but it doesn't answer my question.&nbsp; I want recommendations from somebody's actual experience.&nbsp; I want to know which SOAP implementations "Just Work" as a client against a server implemented by ASP.NET.</p>
<p>Anybody know?</p>
<p></p>
