Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of&nbsp;Exclusivity says that "Two companies cannot own the same word 
in the prospect's mind."</P>
<P>It's time to face the facts.&nbsp; Some of these laws seem to have more punch 
than others.&nbsp; For example, I find the <A 
href="http://software.ericsink.com/item_10178.html">Law of Focus</A> to be a 
concept with a lot of impact.&nbsp; It's very counter-intuitive, and yet very 
powerful.</P>
<P>Other laws here&nbsp;seem almost, well ... obvious.&nbsp; These other laws 
don't seem to deserve their pages quite as much as the great ones like the Law 
of Focus.&nbsp; I speculate that for some reason, Ries and Trout wanted exactly 
22, so they kept adding laws until they got the right number.&nbsp; Too 
bad.&nbsp; If they had stopped at 21 they could have used some sort of a 
blackjack theme.</P>
<P>The&nbsp;Law of Exclusivity&nbsp;would have been a candidate for 
removal.&nbsp; It is fairly intuitive to me that two companies cannot have the 
same market position.</P>
<P>Still, let's not dismiss this law too quickly.&nbsp; After all, obviousness 
is not always a reason to ignore a topic.&nbsp; It is obvious that we should all 
eat better and exercise more, but we don't.</P>
<P>Similarly, marketers do&nbsp;routinely find a way to&nbsp;violate this 
law.&nbsp; They do a&nbsp;Smart Thing by following the Law of Focus and choosing 
one key benefit around which they build their product message.&nbsp; Then do a 
Dumb Thing by choosing the same benefit as somebody else.&nbsp; Almost 
invariably, they end up beating their head against the wall in futility.&nbsp; 
It is obvious that we should not try to beat somebody else at their own 
game.&nbsp; And yet, we often try.</P>
<P>The chapter cites the&nbsp;war between Duracell and Energizer as an 
example.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that even though the book is ten years 
old, this war is still going on, with both companies fighting to own the word 
"long-lasting".&nbsp; I think this is because no other word matters in this 
market segment.&nbsp; What&nbsp;attribute could possibly be more important in a 
battery than "long-lasting"?&nbsp; I think these two companies are doomed to an 
eternity of shouting the same message.&nbsp; Ten years ago, it was apparently 
clear to Ries and Trout that Duracell was the owner of the word 
"long-lasting".&nbsp; I'm not sure this seems so clear to me today, but Duracell 
<A 
href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/CNBCTV/Articles/TVReports/P72274.asp">still</A> 
has the lead with 46% market share to 33% for Energizer.</P>
<P>Incidentally, the fact that this book is ten years old actually makes the 
examples more fun, in my opinion.&nbsp; For example, in the previous chapter, it 
was interesting to read the authors' perspective on Lotus and compare it to the 
ten years of hindsight we now have.</P>
