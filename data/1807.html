<p>"Holy crap, I got it today! It's really awesomely put together; I was expecting something like one of the Internet cheapo two-bucks-per-copy-and-we-print-your-pdf jobs, but this is really nice."</p>

<p>"The best feature of Version Control by Example is the writing style. Much like the 'for Dummies' series, the writing style is light and humorous. This makes it a very easy book to read through, and certainly aids my focus."</p>

<p>"I can't believe the number of times this book has come up in conversation in the last few weeks. I am thinking in a version controlly kinda way now, I just need to sit down and get my hands dirty."</p>

<p>"Very easy to follow, answers many questions (at least in my
case) and is relatively short and compact. You can get through it in a matter
of hours... Explaining by example is a powerful way to learn, so I really recommend
this book if you want to get started with Version Control."</p>

<p>"A really informative chapter about the advantages of third generation
VCS, such as Git, over the second generation ones, such as Subversion and
TFS... A very nice read."</p>

<p><b>"Version Control by Example</b> may as well be called <b>The
Hitchhiker's Guide to Distributed Version Control</b> -- it's a concise and
informative compendium that serves as both an introduction and a manual for
practical usage of Mercurial, Git, Veracity, and virtually any other version
control system."</p>

<p>"Eric covers multiple tools in lighthearted style that makes
a potentially dry subject both amusing and understandable.&nbsp; If version control
is a new tool in your programmers' belt, this book is a great place to start."</p>

<p>"Version control is a critical tool in the developer's tool
chain.&nbsp; So it's disappointing to consider just how few developers actually
understand their version control system beyond the minimal incantations
required merely to survive a day of coding at the office. Thanks to Eric Sink's
new book on the topic, this need be the case no longer.</p>

<p><b>Version Control by Example</b> is organized well, light
in tone, yet saturated with practical illustrations of not only how to choose
among and use today's most popular free version control tools, but how to do so
with efficiency, understanding, and purpose."</p>

<p>"Apache Subversion's rise to popularity opened the
floodgates for others to explore new features and designs in version control,
the most popular being Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). In a
balanced way, this book covers the most popular tools today and whether you
should choose a DVCS for your development."</p>
