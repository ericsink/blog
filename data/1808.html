<h1>SORRY!  We are no longer shipping free books.</h1>

<hr/>

<p>The printed copies of <a
href="{{{link:id='1802'}}}">Version Control by Example</a>
arrived last week.&nbsp; We moved <i>seven tons</i> of books into our fourth-floor
office space and all the tenants on the third floor are still alive.</p>

<p>Now that we have lots of copies, I want to give a bunch of
them away.</p>

<h3>How do I get one of those free books?</h3>

<p>Fill out our book request form at:</p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'><a
href="http://book.sourcegear.com/vcbe/request_book">http://book.sourcegear.com/vcbe/request_book</a></p>

<h3>Do I have to pay for shipping?</h3>

<p>Nope.</p>

<h3>What if I'm outside the United States?</h3>

<p><strike>No problem.</strike>  Sorry, we are no longer shipping books outside the United States.</p>

<h3>I'd prefer to pay for the book.&nbsp; Will the request form accept a credit card
number?</h3>

<p>Nope.</p>

<h3>Don't you at least have a tip jar?</h3>

<p>Nope.</p>

<h3>I really want to pay for my copy.&nbsp; Can't you help me do this?</h3>

<p>OK, fine.&nbsp; The book will also be available <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Version-Control-Example-Eric-Sink/dp/0983507902/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_1">on
Amazon</a>.&nbsp; Things aren't fully set up yet, but the book is in the Amazon
system, and they should be showing it as "in stock" pretty soon.</p>

<h3>Why are you giving away books?</h3>

<p>Because I want to make this content accessible to more
people.&nbsp; Some people like paper.&nbsp; Not everyone reads blogs.</p>

<h3>But isn't this kind of expensive?</h3>

<p>Not really.&nbsp; I've done lots of things crazier than this.&nbsp;
Heck, people often pay more per click on AdWords than it costs to print and
ship a book.</p>

<h3>So this book is just advertising hype?</h3>

<p>Gosh, I hope not.&nbsp; It was written to be balanced and
objective. &nbsp;I had feedback from dozens of reviewers, all of whom were
evaluating the content as a saleable version control book.</p>

<h3>If it's not advertising, then why did you compare your book giveaway to
AdWords?</h3>

<p>Because I <i>do</i> get some benefit from people reading my
book, including increased awareness of me and what I do.</p>

<h3>"Increased awareness"?&nbsp; That still sounds like marketing.</h3>

<p>Yeah kinda.</p>

<p>I just like to write content that (1) people want to read,
and (2) talks about what I am doing.</p>

<p>If I can't talk about what I'm doing while keeping it
interesting for readers, then I'm probably not doing anything interesting.</p>

<p>I've been using this formula on my blog for years. Now I'm
just doing it on paper too.</p>

<h3>Whatever.&nbsp; If you're giving this book away, it must be crap, right?</h3>

<p>Gosh, I hope not.&nbsp; But don't take my word for it.&nbsp; The entire
book is <a href="{{{link:id='1802'}}}">online</a> in
several different formats.&nbsp; The printed edition has the same content -- it's
just prettier.&nbsp; And heavier.</p>

<h3>How long will this offer be available?</h3>

<p>I don't know.&nbsp; We reserve the right to discontinue it or
change the terms at any time.</p>
