<p><span class="ArticleTitle">Case study on SourceGear and C#</span><br><span class="ArticleDate">24 Oct 2003</span></p>
<P>Just in time for PDC 2003, Microsoft has posted a <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/casestudies/CaseStudy.asp?CaseStudyID=14694">case 
study</A> about SourceGear and our use of C# and the .NET Framework.&nbsp; The 
document focuses primarily on our decision to port the SourceOffSite server from 
Java to C#, but also gives a bit of the background on how we came to be .NET 
fans&nbsp;by attending&nbsp;the PDC before this one.</P>
<P>A big thank-you from us to&nbsp;<A href="http://www.inkblog.com/">David 
Weller</A> for helping make this case study happen.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
