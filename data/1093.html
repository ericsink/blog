<h4>Part 1:  The silly and contrived introduction</h4>
<p>I actually do like living here in the Midwest, so I suppose I should stop <a href="{{{link:id='1095'}}}">poking fun</a> at Champaign.&nbsp; But I just can't help it.</p>
<p>It's all Newsweek's fault.&nbsp; Back in November 1998 they ran a feature story giving their list of the ten "Hottest Tech Cities".&nbsp; Champaign was on the list, alongside places like Boston, Austin and Seattle.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was nice to get the attention, but this story was ludicrous.&nbsp; Any honest technology person in Champaign can tell you that in no way does our fine city deserve to be on a list with such elite company.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean the recognition was <em>completely</em> without merit.&nbsp; We've certainly got more interesting high-tech people and stuff here than any other farming community in the Midwest:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The University of Illinois was the site of some of the very earliest work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILLIAC">computers</a>.
</li>
<li>Folks at <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</a> &nbsp;created the Mosaic web browser and the web server which later became Apache.
</li>
<li>Wolfram Research, the producer of <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Mathematica</a>, is the largest ISV in town.&nbsp; Their product is so thoroughly dominant in its market segment that they can do almost everything wrong and still be hugely successful.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.volition-inc.com/">Volition</a> is one of the top game development companies in the world.
</li>
<li>Ralph Johnson is one of the "Gang of Four" authors of the classic book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/sawdust08-20">Design Patterns</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.testing.com/">Brian Marick</a> is one of the leading authorities in the world on the topic of software testing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This last bullet reminds me to check out Brian's <a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog">blog</a> and see what he's up to.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; He's actually not in Champaign at this moment, but rather, in Denver at <a href="http://www.agile2005.org/">Agile 2005</a> where he is one of the keynote speakers.</p>
<p>Which reminds me -- It's time for my annual peek into the world of development methodologies.</p>
<h4>Part 2:  Me and methodologies</h4>
<p>I have never strictly followed any methodology, but I like to read about them, in part because I prefer not to criticize things of which I am ignorant, but also because I like to learn.&nbsp; I'm leading a development team now, so it wouldn't kill me to expose my mind to some ideas from other people.&nbsp; Besides, I already finished the latest Harry Potter book so I need something else to read.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite my natural interest in the topic of methodologies, I have a reputation around SourceGear as someone who hates process and structure:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li>When we announced to the SourceGear team that I would be the project manager for Vault 4.0, I could swear I heard somebody snicker.&nbsp; (<i>All right -- 'fess up!&nbsp; Who was it?</i>)
</li>
<li>When Dan handed me the reins, he jokingly made a crack about me never having "successfully" managed a development team here at SourceGear.&nbsp; (<i>Ouch.&nbsp; Thanks for the 'encouragement'.</i>)
</li>
<li>While catching up with a former coworker yesterday, I mentioned that I was going to be the PM for Vault.&nbsp; He laughed out loud and said, "Oh this should be good.&nbsp; I can't wait to see if you can color inside the lines this time!"&nbsp; (<i>There are LINES ?!?</i>)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive spin: &nbsp;I prefer to think that I am simply more of a leader than a manager.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>More seriously, I don't think my approach to development is all that terrible.&nbsp; I'm not saying I'm the greatest project manager ever, but I actually do have a method to my madness.&nbsp; People who use no process at all are accused of using the methodology called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_and_fix">Code and Fix</a>.&nbsp; My approach just isn't that bad.</p>
<p>But when people ask me which methodology I use, I can't point to any one documented approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just create my own methodology?&nbsp; All I need to do is write a good description of all the practices I tend to intuitively follow and give the result a catchy name like <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">Scrum</a>.&nbsp; Then I can publish my book and recruit thousands of disciples to follow my particular doctrine of development.</p>
<p>But if I did this, I'm pretty sure I would end up creating yet another methodology which would fit squarely under the heading of <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Software Development</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Part 3:  Agile Software Development</h4>
<p>I wish that I too was at Agile 2005 this week.&nbsp; The concept behind Agile Software Development is so very appealing. &nbsp;It all started with a bunch of people who had each developed their own methodology.&nbsp; Somehow they all realized that they had a lot in common, so they got together and identified their common ground.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">#ifdef irrelevant_tangent</span></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Why can't more people do this?&nbsp; Like, for example, protestant churches?&nbsp; Or even, dare I say it, the US Senate?&nbsp; Good things happen when we focus on our common ground instead of on our differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">#endif</span></p>
<p>This "common ground" called Agile is expressed in four basic values:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li><i>Individuals and interactions</i> over processes and tools
</li>
<li><i>Working software</i> over comprehensive documentation
</li>
<li><i>Customer collaboration</i> over contract negotiation
</li>
<li><i>Responding to change</i> over following a plan
</li>
</ul>
<p>These values make a heck of a lot of sense to me, except of course for that bit about tools not being very important.&nbsp; As someone who works for a developer tools vendor, I believe that developer tools are the answer to all of the world's problems, and I don't want people believing otherwise.&nbsp; <b>;-)</b></p>
<p>Anyway, I don't see myself adopting a whole new methodology right now, but I'm still enjoying some of the material I have been reading:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li>I've re-subscribed to Roy Osherove's <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove">blog</a>.&nbsp; I used to read his stuff, but I think I stopped last time I changed aggregators.&nbsp; Roy writes about Agile with a heavy dose of .NET mixed in.
</li>
<li>I found a <a href="http://www.extremeplanner.com/blog/">blog</a> written by somebody at an ISV in the Agile space.
</li>
<li>Martin Fowler has a great <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">overview page</a>.
</li>
<li>The Agile Alliance has some good <a href="http://www.agilealliance.org/programs/roadmaps/Roadmap/index.htm">high level material</a> as well.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've read some of this stuff before, but it's been a while.&nbsp; Maybe I'll learn something.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'll find that one of the existing methodologies happens to exactly describe what I already do.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
<h4>Part 4:  The obligatory crabby remark</h4>
<p>One thing is already clear:&nbsp; I'm pretty sure the <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rup/">Rational Unified Process</a> (RUP) is just not for me.&nbsp; Every time I investigate methodologies I run across RUP.&nbsp; This time I even bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321197704/sawdust08-20">book</a> about it, but the following snippet from the preface scared me away before I even got started:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">"This book is not the complete Rational Unified Process.&nbsp; Rather, it is a small subset to introduce the RUP."</p>
<p>This "introduction" is over 300 pages long!&nbsp; Sorry, but I can't get myself interested in anything that heavy.&nbsp; I see some excellent principles when I scan those pages, but I am inclined to think that any process that large is inherently not very agile.&nbsp; Like I said, I don't like to criticize things I don't understand, but in this case I'll have to make an exception.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
