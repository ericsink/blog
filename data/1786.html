I tried to describe Veracity in a thousand words.&nbsp; Today, let's try a picture.</p>

<p>Veracity's distributed work item tracking feature is one of
several things which is built on that "decentralized database" I mentioned.&nbsp;
This screenshot is Veracity displaying a burndown chart for a Scrum iteration.</p>

<p>The thing on the left is an activity stream.&nbsp; It's a
Twitter-like feature with other notifications mixed in, such as code checkins
and comments on work items.</p>
