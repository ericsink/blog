
<p>With gratitude and a sheepish grin, I&nbsp;take this&nbsp;opportunity to 
mention&nbsp;that SourceGear won a <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/reports/vslivesf/2004/awards/">Readers Choice 
Award</a> at the recent VSLive show.</p>
<p>I wear the sheepish grin for several reasons.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>First of all, I had no idea we were nominated.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>Second, I have no idea who the competition was.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>Third, we won in a category which seems to be an odd fit for our 
  products.
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the gratitude remains.&nbsp; These awards are good-old-fashioned 
popularity contests, and we won.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;always nice to be 
liked.</p>
