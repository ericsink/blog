
<p>Ever since we shipped Vault 2.0 in February, we have been working on the next release.&nbsp; Originally, we planned to call this release version 2.1, but this week we changed our mind.&nbsp; The upcoming release will be called Vault 3.0.</p>
<p>We had some interesting internal discussions here about this decision.&nbsp; All of us here are sensitive to concerns about "version number inflation".&nbsp; However, this release was originally intended to be a short cycle with just a few small incremental improvements over 2.0.&nbsp; Suddenly, eight months have passed, and we've been sneaking-in a lot of cool stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bunches-o-bug-fixes
</li>
<li>Integration with our new bug-tracking product, Dragnet
</li>
<li>Email notifications
</li>
<li>New dialog for adding files, much easier
</li>
<li>New dialog for setting working folders
</li>
<li>Much improved handling of files in status "unknown"
</li>
<li>Greatly simplified license tracking
</li>
<li>Integration with Active Directory
</li>
<li>Several improvements to make Merge Branches even easier to use
</li>
<li>Improvements to the DiffMerge tool, including Unicode support
</li>
<li>Significant improvements to performance and scalability, especially for larger teams
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is merely a change in version number.&nbsp; It does not affect our release schedule.&nbsp; We currently plan to ship Vault 3.0 about 4-6 weeks from now.</p>
<p>Note also that this change also does not affect pricing.&nbsp; All previous releases of Vault have been free upgrades, including version 1.1, version 1.2, and even version 2.0.&nbsp; We had already planned for this release to be the first Vault upgrade which actually costs money.&nbsp; We haven't announced the details of the upgrade pricing yet, but we soon will, and the new version number has made no difference in our plans.</p>
<p>We are quite excited about this release of Vault.&nbsp; It will be faster, more polished, and easier to use than ever before.&nbsp; It deserves to be called 3.0.</p>
