<p>I was saddened this morning to hear that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch">Randy Pausch</a> has lost his
battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Pausch was a CS professor at Carnegie Mellon who became
famous for his <a href="http://www.thelastlecture.com/">Last Lecture</a>,
delivered in September 2007 and later published as a bestselling book.&nbsp; He was
also the creator of the <a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a> software
project.</p>

<p>When a famous person dies, I often find myself appreciating
their work, but I usually cannot say that I feel a personal sense of loss.&nbsp; <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001321/">Richard Harris</a> was fantastic in
every role I have seen him play, but I doubt he and I would have found much to
talk about. &nbsp;For me, Randy Pausch is a special case.&nbsp; All of us are lucky to
have access to his work, but I think the people who really knew him are even
more fortunate.&nbsp; I wish I was one of them.</p>

<p>Every man dies.&nbsp; Not every man truly lives.&nbsp; Rest in peace,
Dr. Pausch.&nbsp; You truly lived.</p>
