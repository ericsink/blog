<P>Ah, it's nice to see my <A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/columns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software10272003.asp">new 
column</A> online on the MSDN website.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>Now that the content is finally "live", I need to tell a story.&nbsp; It's 
embarrassing, but it will be much better if I tell this story myself, rather 
than having everybody hear it from <A href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris 
Sells</A>:</P>
<P>I've never minded being called a "nerd" or a "geek".&nbsp; These terms of 
distinction carry a certain positive connotation.&nbsp; In contrast, the word 
"dork" is a term I prefer not to wear unless I truly deserve it.</P>
<P>Chris contacted me several months ago and asked me to write a column for his 
new <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/">Longhorn Developer Center</A> 
on MSDN.&nbsp; I was flattered and I accepted.&nbsp; We talked about details of 
the column and it all seemed easy enough.&nbsp; He said each installment of the 
column needed to be "of length 2K-4K".&nbsp; No problem.</P>
<P>My first deadline was September 15th.&nbsp; I've never written professionally 
with real deadlines and editors, so I wrote my draft well in advance.&nbsp; It 
was a little tricky, since these columns needed to be quite a bit shorter than 
the stuff I write on my weblog.&nbsp; The weekend before the deadline, I spent a 
whole bunch of time&nbsp;tightening the prose to get it under the 4K 
limit.&nbsp; My final draft was 3,985 bytes -- plenty of room to spare.</P>
<P>I submitted my column to Chris and he seemed shocked.&nbsp; He couldn't 
understand why my draft was so much shorter than the minimum.</P>
<P>I stared at the screen for a moment, completely perplexed.&nbsp; And then I 
realized, when Chris said "2K-4K", the unit of measurement was words, not 
bytes.&nbsp; I thought it was a bit odd to measure written prose in bytes, but 
it never occurred to me that he meant anything else.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>On that particular day, I have to admit, I was a dork.</P>
