<p>Two weeks ago, SourceGear was an exhibitor at the trade show
portion of Tech-Ed in Barcelona, Spain.&nbsp; This was the first time we have been
to this event.&nbsp; In fact, it was the first time SourceGear has been to any trade
show outside the United States.</p>

<p>Personally, I have always wanted to attend Tech-Ed in Barcelona.&nbsp; The event seems to move back and forth between Barcelona and Amsterdam. &nbsp;The
latter doesn't interest me at all, but I love Spain.&nbsp; Going to Barcelona for business would be great, and appending a family vacation would be <a
href="{{{link:id='1639'}}}">even better</a>.</p>

<p>But although we have considered this trip in the past, I
have always resisted it.&nbsp; Even this year, it was all Corey's idea.&nbsp; He thought
we should go, and it obviously didn't take too much arm-twisting for me to
agree, so we went.</p>

<p>But my basic hesitancy remained a concern.&nbsp; I have never
advocated attending a trade show in Europe, for one reason:&nbsp; Our software is
English-only.</p>

<p>To me, it just seems odd to show up at a European trade show
with software that is not internationalized.&nbsp; As I said in my <a
href="{{{link:id='1636'}}}">post</a> from Barcelona two weeks ago, I expected to spend the entire week apologizing for the fact that
we have not localized our products for French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,
Greek, Russian, Hebrew, Polish, or Catalan.</p>

<p>I have always believed that i18n and l10n are important.&nbsp;
Or, to put it another way, I have always felt guilty for the fact that
SourceGear doesn't really do much in this area.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Seriously, localization is one of those features that we
never seem to have time for.&nbsp; It's on the list for every release, and it gets
cut from every release.&nbsp; I feel kind of embarrassed about it.&nbsp; I'm proud to be
an American, but, well, sometimes I'm not.&nbsp; I never wanted to SourceGear to be
one of those arrogant American software companies that simply expects everybody
to speak English.</p>

<p>But right now, that's what we are.&nbsp; So I just figured we
would spend the week in Barcelona receiving complaints from people who want
Vault in their own language.&nbsp; And we planned to be gracious as we received
those gripes, because we deserve them.</p>

<p>But that's not what happened.</p>

<p>We had two booths at this show, one for each division of our
company, SourceGear and Teamprise.&nbsp; There were 7,500 attendees from all over Europe and beyond.&nbsp; The booths were open for four days.&nbsp; We spoke with hundreds of
customers and prospects.&nbsp; We received lots of valuable feedback.&nbsp; People asked
us for all kinds of features.</p>

<p><i>Nobody</i> asked us to localize our products for another
language.</p>

<p>I'll repeat that, just in case you missed it.&nbsp; Here is the
total number of people who asked us about localizing our products in languages
other than English:&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; Cero.&nbsp; Nul.&nbsp; ZÃ©ro.&nbsp; Null. &nbsp;&#1053;&#1091;&#1083;.&nbsp;
&#924;&#951;&#948;&#941;&#957;.</p>

<p>I found this to be simply shocking.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I know that there were some factors biasing things
toward this result:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >SourceGear sells developer tools.&nbsp; Most developers speak
     English.&nbsp; If we were building products for normal people, things would be
     different.</li>
 <li >The primary language for this conference was English.&nbsp;
     People who don't speak English didn't come to the conference.</li>
 <li >We probably spoke with at most ten percent of the show
     attendees.&nbsp; It is merely a coincidence that we didn't get asked.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know all that, so don't post it in my comments.&nbsp; I'm jet-lagged
and crabby and I'm in no mood for people to be telling me the sky is blue.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Still...&nbsp; Zero.</p>

<p>Boggles the mind, doesn't it?</p>

<p>This data point is a biggie.&nbsp; Here are a few more:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Even though our product is English-only, we currently get
     between 30 and 40 percent of our revenue from outside the U.S.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >We do sometimes get requests for non-English localizations
     of our product, but not very often.</li>
 <li >We've actually experimented with a little bit of localization
     work, and the results have been awful.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom says that the
     most important language for localization is Japanese, right?&nbsp; So, in
     coordination with outside partner firms, SourceOffSite has been localized
     for Japanese.&nbsp; In fact, we've done it twice.&nbsp; Both times, the resulting
     revenues were quite low.&nbsp; How low?&nbsp; The English version of SOS outsells
     the J version, in Japan.&nbsp; How low?&nbsp; The monthly revenue from SOS-J and the
     amount of money I spend each month on sushi are in the same ballpark.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now find myself in a very strange place.&nbsp; Empirical data
simply doesn't match my expectations.&nbsp; The world <i>should</i> be punishing me
for my arrogant "American-English-is-the-only-language-that-matters" behavior,
but it's not.&nbsp; Our foreign revenues are solid.&nbsp; We've experimented with
localization and received abysmal results.&nbsp; We've been to a trade show where
most people's first language is not English, and nobody even complained.</p>

<p>I am forced to conclude that localization just doesn't
matter.&nbsp; This isn't the conclusion I expected.&nbsp; It's not the conclusion I
wanted.&nbsp; It doesn't fit my intuition.&nbsp; But it's the only conclusion that fits
the data I've got.</p>

<p>Tell me I'm wrong.&nbsp; I'll listen.&nbsp; But right now, Vault is
English-only, and I think maybe I'm ready to stop feeling guilty about it.</p>
