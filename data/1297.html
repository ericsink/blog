<P>The <A href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/919691.asp?0cv=BB10">AOL/Microsoft 
deal</A>&nbsp;is being widely described as the end of the&nbsp;<A 
href="Browser_Wars.html">browser war</A>.&nbsp; I 
disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the browser war is not over, or it was already 
over.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Because Mozilla is&nbsp;open source, the lizard can never be completely 
  and 100% dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;AOL/Netscape may abandon all support, but the 
  codebase lives on. 
  <LI>You can argue that this deal makes the Netscape browser 
  <EM>effectively</EM> dead, but that was true a long time ago.</LI></UL>
<P>Move along folks, move along, nothing to see here.</P>
