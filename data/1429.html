Kudos to <a href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian</a> for the courageous decision to develop a <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/12/02/2246230&mode=nocomment">proprietary software product</a>.
OK.  <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/665724.asp?0dm=C11RT">Segway</a> looks cool, but is there any chance that its potential has been over-stated?  It is not compatible with our current infrastructure.  It won't keep us dry on rainy days.  It won't make anyone feel macho or powerful while driving it.  It is not useful for lengthy trips.  I admit that the technology and efficiency look very cool, but Americans <b>really</b> like automobiles.  Perhaps this thing will find its true marketplace in Europe or Asia?
