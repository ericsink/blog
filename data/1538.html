Immutable Laws of Marketing</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></P>
<P>The Law of&nbsp;Division observes that over time, a category tends to divide 
and become two or more categories.</P>
<P>A new&nbsp;market category starts out very broad.&nbsp; For example, in the 
beginning of the automobile industry, the only category was "cars".&nbsp; Over 
time, categories break up into smaller and more specialized subcategories.&nbsp; 
Today, there are quite a few brands of car, each catering to a specialized 
niche.</P>
<P>This effect is an obvious and natural consequence of other laws.&nbsp; Each 
company will try to setup a new category in which it can be #1.&nbsp; Not all of 
these categories will end up becoming real, but some will.</P>
<P>This law is a good place to remind ourselves that Ries and Trout primarily 
consult for companies like Pepsi, McDonalds, and General Motors, not for small 
ISVs.&nbsp; There is a bit of an impedance mismatch between their world and 
ours.&nbsp; Those companies do business in mature&nbsp;industries&nbsp;selling 
mass market consumer products.&nbsp; Those products are easily 
interchangeable.&nbsp; I can switch from Pepsi to Coke with no major costs 
associated with the transition and deployment.&nbsp; Categories split into 
subcategories over very slight differences in consumer 
preference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand building is absolutely critical.&nbsp; General 
Motors understands that some car buyers want to feel like they are buying 
something sporty, whereas others want to feel like they are buying something 
conservative.&nbsp; So, they sell basically the same car under the Pontiac and 
the&nbsp;Buick name,&nbsp;managing each of these brands very carefully.&nbsp; 
The underlying engineering is identical, but the message of these two brands is 
very different.</P>
<P>Software isn't usually like that.&nbsp; When people are choosing between <A

href="http://www.softwarefx.com/">Chart FX</A>, brand&nbsp;can be&nbsp;an issue, 
but it is&nbsp;certainly not&nbsp;the only issue.&nbsp; Those two products are 
not identical under the hood.&nbsp; They are not completely 
interchangeable.&nbsp; There are significant differences in features.</P>
<P>So the Law of Division still matters, but it happens a lot less.&nbsp; In 
software, categories don't divide quite as easily as in commodity markets.</P>
<P>But even though categories in software don't usually divide over matters of 
pure message,&nbsp;they do still divide, especially over matters of greater 
substance.&nbsp; My own market is a decent example.&nbsp; In the beginning, 
there was simply "source control".&nbsp; Now, we've got several subcategories 
which came as the market divided over lines such as platform, process and 
integration.</P>
