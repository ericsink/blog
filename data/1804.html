align=right hspace=12>My version control book is finished!&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>The book's home page is at <a
href="http://www.ericsink.com/vcbe">http://www.ericsink.com/vcbe</a>.&nbsp; Right
now you can browse the book online or download a PDF.&nbsp; We're planning Kindle
and EPUB versions, but they're not ready yet.</p>

<p>Printed copies of the book will be available in another week
or two.&nbsp; We've actually got a few now, but we're taking them to <a
href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011">OSCON</a> this week.&nbsp; Once we get the
rest of them from the bindery, we should have plenty to go around.</p>

<h3>More info on the book</h3>

<p>Back around 2004 I wrote a series of blog entries called <a
href="http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html">Source Control HOWTO</a>.&nbsp;
My intent was to turn this content into a book.</p>

<p>But I kept getting distracted by other things.&nbsp; As time
passed, the original material became rather stale.&nbsp; Those blog entries were
written before DVCS became popular.&nbsp; Everything in the version control world is
different now.&nbsp; Eventually I realized that if I wanted to write a book about
version control, I would be starting from scratch.</p>

<p>So I did.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The title of the book is "Version Control by Example".&nbsp; It
     has 13 chapters and is 288 pages long.</li>
 <li >The emphasis of the book is on DVCS.&nbsp; Subversion gets lots
     of attention, but it is the only non-DVCS which is covered beyond a
     passing mention.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >The in-depth examples include four open source version
     control systems:&nbsp; Subversion, Mercurial, Git, and Veracity.</li>
