<h2>Iceberg Sneak-Ins</h2>
<font size=2>28 Apr 2003</font><p>

<P>This morning one of our users sent the following feature request to the Vault 
mailing list:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>When using Vault, I frequently find myself wanting to do some operation, 
  say a "get latest version", in the Vault client and then go to my working 
  folder via windows explorer to do something to the folder/file/etc.&nbsp; It 
  would be really handy to have an "Open working folder" option on the pop-up 
  menu for Vault folders which would open an explorer window to the current 
  working directory (and save me needing to browse to it)....</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(Background:&nbsp; <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear 
Vault</A> is a version control system with a user interface that is essentially 
identical to Visual SourceSafe.)</P>
<P>Within ten minutes, two more people had piled on the bandwagon by sending "me 
too" messages to the list.&nbsp; Clearly this was a featurette that our users 
really wanted.</P>
<P>And I wanted to do it.&nbsp; After all, this is a one-liner, right?&nbsp; As 
soon as I saw the note, the corresponding line of code popped into my head:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT face="Courier New,Courier,monospace" 
  size=2><STRONG>Process.Start(strWorkingFolder);</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We are very close to code freeze for our upcoming 1.1 release, so I went to 
chat with our Project Lead and get his opinion.&nbsp; We both liked the idea, 
but we also both understood the most important rule about sneak-ins:</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4><STRONG>Everything looks easier 
than it really is.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>New features are like icebergs.&nbsp; Most of the effort is invisible, hiding 
below the water, waiting to sink your project.&nbsp; The actual implementation 
effort is the visible part sticking above the water.</P>
<P>Since we can only see the part above the water, most programmers tend to 
forget that anything else exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;We think only about the code, 
ignoring the impact of testing, bug-fixing, tech support, and 
documentation.&nbsp; In fact, sometimes we can't even properly estimate the size 
of the visible piece.&nbsp; In my example, all I could think of was one line. 
:-) </P>
<P>We decided to proceed with this sneak-in and I agreed to implement the whole 
iceberg.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>I went back to my desk and wrote the code.&nbsp; When it was done, I had 
  to laugh at myself.&nbsp; Somehow my "one-line" feature required me to modify 
  <EM>seven</EM> source files.&nbsp; Everything looks easier than it really 
  is:<BR><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>Exactly what text should be used for this new menu item? <BR><BR>
    <LI>Where on the context menu should it be placed? <BR><BR>
    <LI>Should it appear in the main menu, or just on the context menu? <BR><BR>
    <LI>Should the menu item also appear on the toolbar? <BR><BR>
    <LI>What happens if there is no working folder set? <BR><BR>
    <LI>What happens if the working folder is set but it doesn't exist? <BR><BR>
    <LI>What does Process.Start() do when the folder has a space in the 
    name?</LI></UL><BR>
  <LI>After writing the code I checked out the client spec document and updated 
  it with the new menu command.&nbsp; I learned a long time ago that every 
  project manager can choose to spend his life in one of two ways: <BR><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>Getting blamed because he forgot to tell everyone else how the features 
    should work. <BR><BR>
    <LI>Keeping an up-to-date spec and blaming everyone else for not reading 
    it.</LI></UL><BR>
  <LI>Then I wrote some GUI test procedures for the new menu command.&nbsp; We 
  keep documents which contain step-by-step instructions to verify that each 
  feature in Vault works properly.&nbsp; (We also do a lot of automated testing 
  below the GUI level, but that doesn't really apply in this example.) <BR><BR>
  <LI>Then I emailed the person in charge of our documentation to let her know 
  that a new menu item had been added to the client. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Finally, I logged in to our project tracking system and marked issue 5414 
  as fixed.</LI></UL><BR>
<P>Bottom line, this feature really was simple, but not <EM>that</EM> 
simple.&nbsp; Dealing with the whole iceberg took several hours.&nbsp; In 
fact,&nbsp;I won't really be done with the whole iceberg until after this 
feature has passed QA, is being used and shows no problems.&nbsp; That won't 
happen today, so my "one-line" feature will be hanging over my head when I go to 
sleep tonight.</P>
<P>Depending on your environment, the hidden parts of your iceberg might be 
easier than mine.&nbsp; Many teams don't need the formality of documenting test 
procedures.</P>
<P>Alternatively, your situation might be a lot worse.&nbsp; For example, my 
iceberg problems would have been far worse if we were doing localized builds of 
Vault.&nbsp; If you are&nbsp;building multilingual software, new features don't 
even <EM>look</EM> easy.&nbsp; In the worst case, localizing the text on my new 
menu item for N languages would probably have required coordination with N 
people, several of whom are probably at some localization shop seven timezones 
away.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4><STRONG>Sneak-Ins:&nbsp; Tips for 
Project Managers</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>You are the project manager.&nbsp; You are responsible for the health of your 
project.&nbsp; The spec is yours.&nbsp; The schedule is yours.&nbsp; It is your 
job to keep the programmers focused on the stuff that is important.&nbsp; One of 
those programmers brings you a "sneak-in", a feature request which is not 
currently in the plan.&nbsp; What do you do?</P>
<P>A truly conservative manager would almost always say "no".&nbsp; In fact, 
most of the time, that's the right answer.&nbsp; If you want to make your 
deadline, you can increase your odds dramatically by ruthlessly and callously 
saying "no", over and over.</P>
<P>But sometimes the right answer is "yes".&nbsp; Good project managers are made 
entirely out of paranoia, but the truly <EM>extraordinary</EM> project managers 
have a streak of courage.&nbsp; They're not satisfied to merely succeed.&nbsp; 
They <EM>do</EM> want to ship on time, but they also want their product to be 
insanely great.&nbsp; Sneak-ins can sometimes make a huge difference in how you 
and your customers <EM>feel</EM> about a product.&nbsp; In one of the best 
product releases in my experience, the sneak-ins outnumbered the spec features. 
:-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Remember that the person requesting the sneak-in is showing initiative and 
concern.&nbsp; They really want their app to be better.&nbsp; Don't take that 
kind of intrinsic motivation lightly.&nbsp; If the programmer understands the 
whole iceberg and is willing to take real responsibility, give them plenty of 
slack.&nbsp; If you don't, they may soon be working for someone smarter than 
you.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, many sneak-in requests come from people who do not understand 
the whole iceberg.&nbsp; Perhaps they haven't yet been burned by assuming that 
something is a simple as it seems.&nbsp; In these cases, saying "no" is probably 
a good idea, especially as your first response.&nbsp; You can't let half-done 
features destroy your schedule.</P>
<P>But you still need to acknowledge their good intentions.&nbsp; When somebody 
comes into your office with an idea to make your product better, take the time 
to listen to their idea.&nbsp; And take the time to teach them about 
icebergs.</P>

Programmers</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>Three pithy rules:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Understand the iceberg concept. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Get out of your own perspective and see things through the eyes of your 
  customer.&nbsp; Do your customers really want this sneak-in, or is it just 
  you? <BR><BR>
  <LI>It's easier to get forgiveness than permission.<img src="smiley.gif"></LI></OL>
