<P>The Law of&nbsp;the Ladder acknowledges that in&nbsp;most market categories, 
there is actually more than one available slot in the mind of the customer.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>The Hierarchy of 
Categories</FONT></P>
<P>In our discussion of the previous laws, we have emphasized the importance 
being different, the important of finding a subcategory in which you can be 
#1.&nbsp; However, when you pop the stack frame up one level to the enclosing 
category, we find that you are ranked on a ladder among the other players.</P>
<P>I claim that my product, SourceGear Vault, is&nbsp;#1 in its category, which 
I define here as "compelling and seamless replacements for Visual 
SourceSafe".&nbsp; However, this category is actually&nbsp;just one 
small&nbsp;subcategory&nbsp;inside a larger one which I might call "basic source 
control tools".&nbsp; Vault is definitely not&nbsp;#1 in that category.&nbsp; 
We're just somewhere on the ladder along with a bunch of other products.&nbsp; 
There&nbsp;is a&nbsp;sister category here called "process-based source control 
tools".&nbsp; Both of these categories are enclosed in yet another category 
called "all configuration management tools".&nbsp; That category is enclosed 
inside another one called "developer tools".&nbsp; SourceGear is a small 
ISV.&nbsp; The bigger the category, the farther down the ladder we are.</P>
<P>Reading this book, it's easy to get confused about which level of category is 
being discussed.&nbsp; Does a certain law apply to the whole market, or just to 
my category, or to my sub-category, or to my sub-sub-category?&nbsp; The fact 
that this hierarchy of enclosing categories is highly subjective doesn't 
help.&nbsp; Sometimes a law makes more sense when it is understood to apply to 
the larger enclosing categories.</P>
<P>For now, let's just remember that every category level has its own 
ladder.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Three Tidbits about 
Ladders</FONT></P>
<P>1.&nbsp; The mind of the customer can only remember a few rungs.&nbsp; 
Research indicates a maximum of about seven, and a more practical limit of about 
two or three.&nbsp; How many brands of toothpaste can you name?&nbsp; How many 
brands of cola?&nbsp; How many brands of automobiles?&nbsp; Some categories have 
more rungs than others.</P>
<P>2.&nbsp; The best strategy for you depends entirely on your ranking on the 
ladder.&nbsp; The right strategy for the #1 player is probably wrong for the #2 
player, and vice versa.&nbsp; The authors cite the Avis rent-a-car example, 
where they gained tremendous results from simply acknowledging their status as 
#2.&nbsp; This example has been very much-discussed in the ten years since the 
book was written, but it still rings with a bell of wisdom.&nbsp; Avis showed a 
lot of self-awareness.&nbsp; Customers respected that.</P>
<P>3.&nbsp; There is a&nbsp;typical mapping of market share onto ladder 
position.&nbsp; The authors claim that each rung on the ladder has twice the 
market share of the rung below it.&nbsp;&nbsp;These guidelines are obviously 
very rough, and all kinds of exceptions do apply.&nbsp; Still, when we see a 
ladder where the market share ratios are not even close to this rule of thumb, 
we are motivated to ask why.</P>
<P>Tomorrow we will talk more about this third tidbit in our discussion of the 
Law of Duality.</P>
