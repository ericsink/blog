<p>Two months ago, Joel Spolsky published an essay entitled <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">Hitting the High
Notes</a> in which he uses the metaphor of vocalists to explain something about
software developers.&nbsp; In a nutshell, I would paraphrase his article like this:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Great software products don't
happen without the very best software developers, just as certain musical
performances simply don't happen unless the performers have someone who can hit
the high notes.&nbsp; These "peaks" in performance are the result of certain
individuals with extraordinary talent, and there is no substitute.&nbsp; You can't
reach these peaks through the sum of talent levels.&nbsp; Your opera score says the
tenor needs to be able to hit a high B.&nbsp; Adding baritones won't help increase
the vocal range.&nbsp; It just makes the group louder.&nbsp; Similarly, adding mediocre
programmers doesn't increase the talent range to the point where they can
create something insanely great.</p>

<p>I really like this metaphor, but it's a two-sided coin.&nbsp; High
notes are amazing, but harmony is powerful.&nbsp; I am not disagreeing with Joel's
metaphor.&nbsp; Rather, I like his metaphor so much that I want to finish it.&nbsp; Joel
spoke of individual talent in terms of a soloist.&nbsp; I want to speak of team
talent in terms of a choir.</p>

<h2>A <u>serious</u> choir</h2>

<p>Mention of the word "choir" can conjure up lots of different
images.&nbsp; Perhaps the first thing that popped into your mind was your child's second
grade holiday program.&nbsp; Those events are special memories and the reason why we
buy camcorders, but that's not really what I'm talking about.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Maybe when you think of a choir you think of your church
choir which does a special song on the fifth Sunday and where the average age
of the women in the alto section is 92.&nbsp; I think it's great that churches
create opportunities for people to sing, but that's not really what I'm talking
about.</p>

<p>I'm talking about a <i>serious</i> choir, which is a choir that
could be described like this:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >All of the choir members had to audition to get in, and
     lots of people didn't make the cut.</li>
 <li >The director is formally trained.</li>
 <li >All of the voices start and stop at exactly the same
     instant.</li>
 <li >When the choir is singing softly, there is no less
     intensity than when they are singing loudly.</li>
 <li >When they perform <a
     href="http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/what_child_is_this_version_1.htm">What
     Child is This?</a> at their holiday concert, <i>nobody</i> takes a breath
     in the middle of a line.&nbsp; (In the proper singing of that piece, the
     singers are allowed to breathe four times per stanza, not eight.)</li>
 <li >The people in the audience are not wearing jeans.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have never heard a truly excellent choir, I highly
recommend that you invest the time.&nbsp; Most universities have at least one
serious choir.&nbsp; Go listen to their next concert.&nbsp; The experience can be very
moving.&nbsp; You might be amazed.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the point.&nbsp; Like I said, Joel's metaphor is
a two sided coin:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The "high notes" side of this coin speaks of what you cannot
     obtain through addition.&nbsp; You cannot get the range of a soprano by adding
     several altos.&nbsp; A really outstanding programmer is ten times better than
     an average one, but you can't get the same results by hiring ten average
     programmers.</li>
 <li >The "choir" side of this coin speaks of what you cannot
     obtain without addition.&nbsp; The most talented vocalist can't sing a chord.&nbsp;
     In music, there are things only a choir can do.&nbsp; In software, there are
     things only a team can do.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most obvious thing here is simply the benefit of size.&nbsp;
Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a> would
agree that there is usually a positive correlation between team size and its
production capacity.&nbsp; Suppose you have two teams, one with 50 people and one
with just a single person working alone.&nbsp; Hand each team the spec to develop a new
CAD system.&nbsp; No matter how many high notes the lonely coder can reach, I don't
think he's going to finish first.</p>

<p>A plurality of programmers offers other benefits as well.&nbsp;
Things like <a href="http://www.pairprogramming.com/">pair programming</a>,
brainstorming, and code reviews all make sense only in the context of a team.</p>

<p>Okay -- enough stating the obvious.&nbsp; We all agree on the
value of good teams.</p>

<h2>The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few...</h2>

<p>For a soloist, hitting the high notes is an essential
skill.&nbsp; In a choir, the essential skill is the ability to blend.&nbsp; Some of the
most gifted soloists just don't have the stuff it takes to fit in a really
great choir.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sometimes, they <i>can't</i> blend.&nbsp; Their voice is the
problem.&nbsp; A really distinctive voice is an asset to a soloist but is a
disadvantage in a choir.&nbsp; They can't blend because that's just the way their
voice is.</p>

<p>More commonly, they <i>won't</i> blend.&nbsp; Participation in a
serious choir requires a generosity that simply is not present in everyone.&nbsp;
Choir members don't get individual accolades or fame.&nbsp; Soloists do.</p>

<p>It happens in music, in sports and in software development.&nbsp;
The super-talented people are often the very same people who have trouble
blending into a team.&nbsp; Serious choirs (or software teams) are successful when
they are built with people who genuinely want success for the concert (or the
product) more than they want success for themselves. </p>

<h2>So are you saying we should forget about the high notes?</h2>

<p>Certainly not.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that you hire "mediocre
programmers".&nbsp; By all means, continue to look for people who can hit the high
notes.&nbsp; But I daresay Joel would agree that any team built exclusively with that
criterion is likely to develop other problems.&nbsp; Be it a choir or a team, you
want every member to be at the highest possible talent level.&nbsp; But the people
on your team have to be willing and able to blend.</p>

<h2>Two kinds of talent</h2>

<p>So Joel is right:&nbsp; Creative technical genius (the ability to
hit the high notes) is a critical ingredient when building insanely great
products.&nbsp; But it's not the only one.</p>

<p>In every choir I have seen, there are certain vocalists which
surface as leaders.&nbsp; Their leadership is visible only to the other members of
the choir, never to the audience.&nbsp; As an example, let's consider Jane, a
soprano who sings in the third row of the Fog Creek choir.&nbsp; During rehearsals,
Jane sings her part confidently and with full voice, because she is highly
talented and has the ability to "sight read" the musical score.&nbsp; The sopranos
near Jane are probably talented as well, but to at least some degree, their
confidence is being increased by listening to Jane.</p>

<p>At concert time, the audience can't tell that Jane is any
different from the rest.&nbsp; She isn't hitting notes any higher than the other
sopranos.&nbsp; She is blending, just as she should be.</p>

<p>Is Jane one of those vocalists who can hit the high notes?&nbsp;
Probably.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; Either way, she is applying a talent which is just as
valuable in the context of a choir:&nbsp; She makes everyone around her better.</p>

<p>The same effect is visible in software.&nbsp; Great <a
href="{{{link:id='1208'}}}">developers</a> don't just
make the product better -- they make everybody around them better.</p>

<p>So when hiring developers, always ask <i>both</i> questions:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The "high notes" question:&nbsp; <br>
     How much talent does this developer have to help make our <i>product</i> great?</li>
 <li >The "choir" question:&nbsp; <br>
     How much talent does this developer have to help make our <i>team</i> great?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only ask the choir question, you might end up with a group
of highly cooperative people who work very well together as a team.&nbsp; But they never
create anything worthy of buzz.&nbsp; Instead of high notes, they produce a peaceful
chord as they build boring products that nobody wants.</p>

<p>If you only ask the high notes question, you might end up
with a group of highly talented people who will reach great peaks as
individuals.&nbsp; But they never really work <i>together</i>.&nbsp; Instead of harmony,
they produce noise as they build poorly integrated products that draw attention
but not users.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
