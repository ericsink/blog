<p>Since my first <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software09012004.asp">article</a> about "micro-ISVs", I have been surprised how often I see people using this term in blogs and discussion forums.</p>
<p>Now, I find myself wishing I had thought to buy the <a href="http://www.microisv.com/">domain name</a>.&nbsp; :-)</p>
