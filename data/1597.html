<p>For years I have wished that Sun would make Java truly <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a>.&nbsp; Two days ago, Sun's
executives publicly committed to make it happen.&nbsp; Now I have to figure out
why I don't care.</p>

<p>Actually, I <i>do</i> care.&nbsp; In fact, I'm angry.&nbsp; Java had so much
potential, and most of its opportunities are lost.&nbsp; Java today is like
what Tiger Woods would have been if his Dad had made him live at home until he
was forty.</p>

<p>At the age of 3, Tiger Woods played nine holes of golf and shot a 48.&nbsp;
His father saw the potential and dedicated himself to helping his son become
all that he could be.&nbsp; In the early years, this meant strict
control.&nbsp; Later, the father's primary role was to simply never be obstacle
in his son's path.</p>

<p>Am I being outrageous by comparing Java to Tiger Woods?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;
Everybody knows that parents who want their kids to realize their full
potential need to let them go.&nbsp; But Java is not a child; it's an
intellectual property asset.&nbsp; Like I said, I'm angry -- don't expect me to
be entirely rational about this.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>But even if my illustration is absurd, I want to finish it:&nbsp; Earl Woods
(who sadly lost his battle with cancer just a few weeks ago) will primarily be
remembered as the man who allowed his son to reach his full potential and
become the best golfer in the world.&nbsp; In contrast, Sun will primarily be
remembered as the company who created Java and then impeded its success by
retaining strict control over it.</p>

<p>So on Tuesday Jonathan Schwartz and Rich Green promised that sometime soon,
their 40-year old daughter Java will be allowed to quit her job in the family
business and begin a pro golfing career.&nbsp; Frankly, it's a little late for
that.</p>

<p>Please don't put labels on me.&nbsp; I'm not an open source zealot.&nbsp;
I'm not a .NET zealot.&nbsp; I'm not a Java zealot.&nbsp; I'm just angry.&nbsp;
I don't understand why Sun couldn't make this decision seven years ago when it
might have made a difference.</p>

<p>Is it really too late?&nbsp; Perhaps not, but the remarks by Schwartz and
Green this week indicate that these guys still don't really &quot;get
it&quot;.&nbsp; They showed up at JavaOne to announce their intentions, but
they had no details of how it's going to happen.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Reading between the lines, their attitude suggests that the reason they don't have a plan
yet is that they are still trying to figure out how they can make Java Open
Source while continuing to remain in complete control over it.&nbsp; Yeah --
good luck with that.</p>

<p>If Java is going to realize at least some of its potential, Sun will need to
get <i>really</i> serious about <a
href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/let-java-go.html">letting Java go</a>.&nbsp;
That means facing what appear to be their two primary fears:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li >If we make Java truly Open Source, will it benefit Sun as
     a company?</li>
 <li >If we make Java truly Open Source, won't that encourage
     people to fork?</li>
</ol>

<p>Seven years ago, the answers were:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li >Yes.&nbsp; It will benefit Sun, but not directly.&nbsp;
     Releasing Java as Open Source will change the industry.&nbsp; Finding ways
     to profit from that change is a separate step that Sun needs to figure
     out.&nbsp; If you do it right, then dozens of vendors will have a common
     foundation upon which they can unify against Microsoft.&nbsp; Sun can be
     one of the leaders, along with companies like IBM, Motorola, and Apple.</li>
 <li >Probably not.&nbsp; People don't fork projects when the
     primary maintainer is doing a good job.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today, the answers are completely different:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li >No.&nbsp; It won't benefit Sun.&nbsp; You already screwed
     it up so badly that it no longer matters what you do.&nbsp; Your company
     is just waiting to die, and unlike the situation with Earl Woods, most
     people will be struggling to find anything nice to say at its funeral.</li>
 <li >Definitely.&nbsp; If you Open Source Java on a Monday, a
     community fork will be the most active project on SourceForge by the end
     of the week.&nbsp; Dozens or hundreds of people will be granted commit
     access.&nbsp; None of them will be Sun employees.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, wait -- that's the anger talking.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b>&nbsp; Let me try
again:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li >Maybe. &nbsp;This isn't the high-percentage play that it
     would have been seven years ago, but there is still a chance that you can
     catalyze some major change.&nbsp; If that happens, and if you swallow your
     pride, you can probably find a way to be a leader.</li>
 <li >Probably, but maybe not.&nbsp; The way to prevent a fork
     is to take away the motivation to fork.&nbsp; If you show the Open Source
     community that you &quot;get it&quot;, you will have countless allies and
     fans in your community instead of countless developers trying to repress
     all memory of you as they fix your bugs.</li>
</ol>

<p>I confess that I gave up on Java years ago.&nbsp; I'm a C# developer now,
but I don't get religious about platforms.&nbsp; If it's not too late, I would
still love to see Java realize its incredible potential.</p>

<p>If that's going to happen, I see only one possibility:&nbsp; Crazy as it may
sound, Sun needs to stop thinking of itself as Java's owner and start thinking
of itself as Java's proud parent.&nbsp; Sun, your child was born to change the
world, and the only thing preventing that from happening is you.</p>
