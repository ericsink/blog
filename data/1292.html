<P>Context is critical.&nbsp; Management advice can be worthless or worse if it 
is not appropriate for your situation.&nbsp; The right decisions for a big 
company can be fatal in a small one.&nbsp; Make sure you consider your context 
before you listen to anybody's management drivel, including mine.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>I&nbsp;run a small ISV (Independent Software Vendor) with no substantial 
outside funding.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear</A> 
is&nbsp;6 years old and has 25 employees.&nbsp; I've learned plenty of 
interesting lessons along the way.&nbsp; One of the things I've learned is that 
a small ISV should not have any programmers.</P>
<P>For the purpose of this article, a "programmer" is someone who does nothing 
but code new features and [if you're lucky] fix bugs.&nbsp; They don't write 
specs.&nbsp; They don't write automated test cases.&nbsp; They don't help keep 
the automated build system up to date.&nbsp; They don't help customers work out 
tough problems.&nbsp; They don't help write documentation.&nbsp; They don't help 
with testing.&nbsp; They don't even <EM>read</EM> code.&nbsp; All they do is 
write new code.&nbsp; In a small ISV, you don't want <EM>any</EM> of these 
people in your company.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Instead of "programmers" (people that specialize in writing code), what you 
need are "developers" (people who will contribute in multiple ways to make the 
product successful).</P>
<P>My apologies if I'm trying to be too cute with my word definitions, but it 
really doesn't matter what terminology you use.&nbsp; In a small ISV you can't 
afford to have people who think their only responsibility is writing code.&nbsp; 
There are far too many other things to be done, all of which are critical to 
having a successful product.&nbsp; If you were a BigCo, you would just hire more 
specialists until every job function is covered.&nbsp; But as a small ISV, what 
you need are fewer people who are more versatile.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Boundaries vs. 
Flexibility</FONT></P>
<P>This is a&nbsp;really important&nbsp;difference between small companies and 
big ones:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>In a small firm, most people wear multiple hats.&nbsp; It simply isn't 
  feasible to have a person who focuses on just one small area.&nbsp; Small 
  companies need versatile people who are content and capable to step in and do 
  whatever it takes to help the company succeed.&nbsp; One accountant or 
  bookkeeper handles basically everything.&nbsp; There is often a utility 
  infielder who is always busy but nobody knows what they do.&nbsp; The key 
  concept here is flexibility.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Big companies have more specialists.&nbsp; Payroll is different from 
  "accounts receivable" which is separate from "accounts payable".&nbsp; 
  Architects do design.&nbsp; Programmers write code.&nbsp; Technical Leads 
  manage programmers.&nbsp; Program Managers keep the spec and schedule.&nbsp; 
  Product Managers do positioning and message.&nbsp; Evangelists do, er, well, 
  nobody really knows what evangelists do.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> Anyway, each person 
  has a specific, well-defined job.&nbsp; The key concept here is respect for 
  boundaries.</LI></UL>
<P>By the way, these are two very different cultures and ugly things can happen 
when they intersect.&nbsp; Flexibility and boundaries don't mix very well.&nbsp; 
A person who&nbsp;has been&nbsp;successul in one of these cultures often 
stumbles badly when they transition to the other one.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Developers</FONT></P>
<P>In a small ISV, every developer is first and foremost a programmer.&nbsp; The 
bulk of their time should be spent writing code and fixing bugs.&nbsp; But every 
developer also needs to be involved in other areas such as the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Spec documents 
  <LI>Configuration management 
  <LI>Code reviews&nbsp; 
  <LI>Testing 
  <LI>Automated tests 
  <LI>Documentation 
  <LI>Solving tough customer problems </LI></UL>
<P>Using my terminology, these things are the difference between a programmer 
and a developer.&nbsp; The developer has a much larger perspective and an 
ability to see the bigger picture.&nbsp; The programmer writes code, throws it 
over the wall to the testers and waits for them to log bugs.&nbsp; The developer 
knows it is better to find an fix bugs now, since he just might be the one 
talking to the customer about it later.</P>
<P>When your team evolves from programmers to developers, your pecking order may 
change.&nbsp; Your best developer may not be the person who usually gets thrown 
the really tough problems.&nbsp; A programmer of amazing talent can be a lousy 
developer.&nbsp; Coding is a necessary but insufficient part of being a 
developer.&nbsp; Similarly, the less gifted members of your team can still 
distinguish themselves as excellent developers through their contributions to 
the non-coding parts of the product.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Frequently Asked 
Questions</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Can't we just let our programmers be coders and hire a 
separate group to do everything else?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Maybe.&nbsp; SourceGear has tried it this way in the past, and sometimes it 
  has worked well.&nbsp; But in the long run you will regret the decision to 
  insulate your programmers from everything but code.&nbsp; Programmers in a 
  small ISV have too much influence to let them have a narrow perspective.&nbsp; 
  Make them see the perspective of the user.&nbsp; Put&nbsp;your 
  programmers&nbsp;on the phone to help a customer with a tough problem.&nbsp; 
  Your product quality will improve&nbsp;as you expose programmers to the 
  consequences of the bugs they create.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Our programmers don't know how to do all this other 
stuff.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Really?&nbsp; Surely the university CS programs are teaching SCM tools and 
  tech support skills, right?&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
  <P>Yeah, <A href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/">my school</A> didn't teach this 
  stuff either.&nbsp; It's a foregone conclusion that your programmers don't 
  know how to do the non-coding aspects of product development.&nbsp; Teach 
  them.</P>
  <P>Formal training might play a part here, but the best learning comes from 
  experience.&nbsp; Your developers need to borrow the advice of Nike and "Just 
  Do It".&nbsp; Make sure they are allowed to fail.&nbsp; Let them learn from 
  their mistakes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Our&nbsp;programmers don't <EM>want</EM> to do all this 
other stuff.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Some people don't want to be developers -- they want to be 
  programmers.&nbsp; That's okay.&nbsp; A programmer can have a fine 
  career.&nbsp; But you and the programmer may want to 
  talk&nbsp;frankly&nbsp;about whether&nbsp;your small ISV environment is the 
  right fit.</P>
  <P>Ultimately you can decide to manage this in whatever way makes sense for 
  <EM>your</EM> context.&nbsp; I'm suggesting that every programmer in a small 
  ISV needs to be getting involved in <EM>something</EM> beyond the code, but 
  most rules have exceptions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Isn't it rare to find developers who have such a diverse 
skill set?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Yep.&nbsp; True developers are precious&nbsp; You probably can't hire them 
  from the outside.&nbsp; You have to help your programmers morph to become 
  developers.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>Once they do, you&nbsp;may have to work very hard to keep them.&nbsp; When 
  a developer leaves, he or she will either become a manager at a BigCo or a 
  founder of their own company.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>How do developers get any code written if they're 
constantly being interrupted with other stuff?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>Yep, that's a problem.&nbsp; I'll take this opportunity to cite Eric's 
  Axiom of Software Management:</P>
  <P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=center><FONT 
  face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif><STRONG>You can't eliminate problems, <BR>but 
  you <EM>can</EM>&nbsp;make trades</STRONG></FONT><STRONG><FONT 
  face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif>&nbsp;<BR>to get problems that you prefer 
  <BR>over the ones you have now.</FONT>&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
  <P>Your developers still need flow time or they will never get any code 
  written.&nbsp; This problem is far preferable to the set of problems you get 
  when you surround yourself with people that have a narrow "code-only" 
  perspective.&nbsp; Try to structure your time.&nbsp; For example, don't try to 
  write code and do tech support on the same day.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>So are you saying our developers have to do <EM>all</EM> 
that other stuff?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>No.&nbsp; Ideally, your developers still spend most (but not all) of their 
  time writing code.&nbsp; If your budget allows, there are several categories 
  of specialists that you might want to consider hiring:</P>
  <P><STRONG>"Level 1" technical support</STRONG></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P>A&nbsp;lot of technical support work involves answering the same 
    questions over and over.&nbsp; This is probably not the best use of a 
    developer's time.&nbsp; Keep your developers involved in "level 2" support, 
    diagnosing and solving customer problems which are tough and 
    mysterious.&nbsp; But it's a good idea to have&nbsp;one or 
    more&nbsp;specialists to catch all the easier stuff.&nbsp; We usually look 
    for someone with good communication skills and some sort of a background in 
    technology or science.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><STRONG>Manual testing, bugfix verification, etc.</STRONG></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P>As long as you're building a level 1 support team, overstaff it by just a 
    little.&nbsp; Give them some slack time so they can be involved in a certain 
    amount of QA work.&nbsp; Let them do some of the manual testing and bugfix 
    verification work.&nbsp; This will reduce the load on your developers and 
    will dramatically slow down the burnout rate for people in pure tech support 
    positions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><STRONG>Documentation</STRONG></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P>Have your developers write the spec or the first draft of content, but 
    the final creation and editing of your documentation is a job best suited 
    for someone who can spell.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><STRONG>System administration</STRONG></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P>Your developers probably <EM>can</EM> do sysadmin work, but there's no 
    particular product-related reason for them to do so.&nbsp; Hiring a sysadmin 
    person is one way to reduce the distractions on your 
  developers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
