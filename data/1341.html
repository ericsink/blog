<P>Like any other business, SourceGear evolves.&nbsp; Today I would like to let 
the world know about a change that has happened recently here at 
SourceGear.&nbsp; This change is important but not highly visible to our 
customers.</P>
<P>As of January 1st, SourceGear has been restructured at the corporate 
level.&nbsp; Previously, we were "SourceGear Corporation", but now we are 
"SourceGear LLC".&nbsp; However, the important thing here is not the slight 
variation in the name, but rather, the major change in ownership.</P>
<P>Back in 1997, the first two people I hired were Dan Schreiber and Corey 
Steffen.&nbsp; Since then, these two guys have become the backbone of our 
company.&nbsp; Corey and Dan are the ones who make things happen here at 
SourceGear.&nbsp; Furthermore, they participate in all major decisions of the 
company.&nbsp; In the last two years, they have come to function less as my 
employees and more as my partners.&nbsp; Last fall, I decided it was time that 
this arrangement be formalized.</P>
<P>It took some time to get all the legal work done, but the deal was completed 
on January 1st.&nbsp; Instead of being the principal owner of SourceGear, I am 
now just one of three, and I could not be happier with the change.</P>
<P>Like I said, this change will be mostly invisible to the rest of the 
world.&nbsp; Corey and Dan are a bit quieter than I am.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
<P>Still, this is something I want people to know.</P>
