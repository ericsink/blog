<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Earlier today a former coworker
emailed me and asked me to critique his product idea.&nbsp; Here is a lightly edited
snippet from the message I sent in response:</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>I don't know squat about whether you could actually sell
this, but here are my two cents:&nbsp; Some products ideas fall into a category
I call &quot;Just Do It&quot;.&nbsp; This is probably one of them.&nbsp; It
sounds kind of cool.&nbsp; It's not going to be all that difficult to
implement.&nbsp; You have the time to spend on it.&nbsp; Basically, there isn't
enough risk here to worry about.&nbsp; You could spend a lot of time trying to
figure out if this idea is any good, and at the end, you wouldn't really know.&nbsp;
Alternatively, you could spend the same amount of time implementing this idea,
after which you will have the opportunity to really find out if it's any good.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>Lots of small ISV ideas don't fit this philosophy, but I bet
this one does.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>Sorry if I sound too preachy, but you've struck a favorite
chord of mine.&nbsp; I think there is a lot to be said for smaller ideas.&nbsp;
Try it.&nbsp; If it fails, get another small idea and try that one.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in'>I'd bet the odds of success with ten small ideas are a LOT
better than the odds of success with one idea that is ten times bigger.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>I am tempted to write a full
blown article on this topic.&nbsp; But then I would have to think about how to
structure the article.&nbsp; And then I would have to find several examples and
stories to illustrate the point.&nbsp; And then I would have to think of all the
situations where my point is wrong (like when you have VC funding) and
acknowledge and explain each one.&nbsp; And then I would read the article and
realize it's boring so I would have to try to figure out some way to make it
funny and would probably end up restructuring the whole thing.&nbsp; And then I
would have to spend a few hours reviewing the essay to make sure all the
transitions work.&nbsp; And then I would have to spend a couple hours looking for
places where a hyperlink to other sources would be appropriate.&nbsp; I then I would
have to spend twenty minutes looking for a place to gratuitously insert a link
to the IMDB page for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets
Society</a>.&nbsp; And then I would have to spend a day proofreading.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Bottom line:&nbsp; I would spend two
weeks of careful prudence to write an article which says little more than "carpe
diem".&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>That would be just so wrong.</p>
