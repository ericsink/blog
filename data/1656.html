<p>It only happens about once a year.&nbsp; Some nitwit reads my
articles and sends me hate mail, accusing me of holding back my best secrets to
preserve an advantage.&nbsp; His theory looks like this:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >There exists a collection of secrets which are the key to
     success.</li>
 <li >Mere possession of these secrets is the only thing which
     distinguishes those of us who thrive from those who do not.</li>
 <li >Those of us who know these secrets have sworn an oath to
     keep them concealed and prevent the struggling lower class from getting
     all uppity.</li>
</ul>

<p>I assume this guy has equally interesting ideas about Area
51 and the grassy knoll.</p>

<p>Actually, I sort of wish he was right.&nbsp; I consider his
scenario to be a very pleasant fiction, to selfishly guard the true secrets of
success while writing books and articles that contain everything but.&nbsp; I don't
think I'm really that evil, but I could aspire to be.</p>

<p>Alas, the truth is that no such secrets exist.&nbsp; When I write
an article on a topic, I include everything that I think might be useful to the
reader.&nbsp; I'm not holding anything back.&nbsp; </p>

valuable strategic and tactical tips that I know.&nbsp; These aren't the sort of
mythical secrets described above, but they're pretty close.</p>

<p>The information I am going to reveal in this article is so
valuable that it actually can be a difference maker in your success.</p>

<p>These tips will help you get ahead of your competitors in
one area where it really counts.</p>
