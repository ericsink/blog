<p>
Service Pack 1 for the .NET Framework appears
to break compatibility in a way that causes
major problems for SourceGear Vault.  

</p>
<p>It is VERY IMPORTANT that Vault users do NOT 
install this service pack on the machine hosting 
the  Vault server.  Doing so will cause damage 
to your Vault database.

</p>
<p>Vault 2.0.6 will include a workaround for this
problem and will be released as soon as we finish
testing it.</p>
