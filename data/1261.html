Wow.  How ironic (and fun) that the first time SourceGear gets <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/751496.asp">mentioned</a> on MSNBC.com, it is for AbiWord.  <img src="smiley.gif">  Here at SourceGear we're all about .NET now, out of the open source world completely.  But it's still cool to see the mainstream press talking about something that got its start right here.
