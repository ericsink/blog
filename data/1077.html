<h2>Vault 2.0:  Major Price Reduction</h2>
<font size=2>13 Feb 2004</font><p>

<P>I am very pleased to announce that SourceGear has just released version 2.0 
of <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">Vault</A>, our source control tool 
for Windows developers.&nbsp; This new release is a major step forward in 
features and performance (and it is a free upgrade for all Vault users).&nbsp; 
If you have been hearing great things about Vault from the early adopters, but 
have been waiting for it to grow out of its 1.x immaturity, we invite you to 
give our product a fresh look.</P>
<P>And for those of you who have found Vault's price to be an obstacle, we have 
good news for you too.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>One of the most difficult decisions in a <A 
href="http://software.ericsink.com/Small_ISV_Defined.html">small ISV</A> is 
product pricing.&nbsp; When we shipped Vault 1.0 (almost exactly one year ago), 
we spent a lot of time trying to decide how much to charge for it.&nbsp; In the 
end, we settled on a base price of $399 per user, with no standard volume 
discounts available.&nbsp; We were&nbsp;very tempted to price it lower, but we 
didn't want our product to be priced dramatically cheaper than the offerings 
from other source control vendors.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the other serious source 
control tools are several hundreds dollars and up.&nbsp; We think our product is 
just as good as theirs.&nbsp; Why should we not price it accordingly?&nbsp; Many 
small ISVs make the mistake of setting their initial pricing too low, and I know 
better.</P>
<P>However,&nbsp;the popularity of Vault has overwhelmed us.&nbsp; Sales have 
exceeded our projections.&nbsp; The basic message of our product has resonated 
with lots of people who are grateful to have found <A 
href="http://vaultthemovie.com/">a compelling replacement for Visual 
SourceSafe</A>.</P>
<P>As the months have passed, we have been constantly getting feedback from 
people who say Vault is too expensive.&nbsp; Granted, a certain amount of this 
kind of feedback is very healthy for a small ISV.&nbsp; There will always been 
someone who thinks <STRONG>any</STRONG> price is too high.&nbsp; If absolutely 
nobody is complaining, then it is very likely your price is too low.</P>
<P>Still, the feedback from these people was unsettling.&nbsp; We had started to 
feel&nbsp;almost like an evil drug company with an important new medicine which 
is priced so high that only the rich can afford it.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>Seriously, we want to attract a much larger user base for Vault, so we have 
decided to reduce our prices quite significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new prices vary 
by quantity.&nbsp; The <A 
href="https://store.sourcegear.com/sgstore/orderform.aspx?family=vault">gory 
details</A> are available in our online store, but in a nutshell, the good news 
is this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=4>With volume discounts, Vault user licenses <BR>are now priced 
  as low as $100 per user.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We are hoping this new pricing makes Vault compelling for a 
<STRONG>lot</STRONG> more people than before.</P>
