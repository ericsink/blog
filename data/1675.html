<p>The Evil Mastermind comic series continues to move along:</p>

 <li ><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/ads/SGad3.pdf">Episode
     3</a> <span style='font-size:9.0pt'>(2.8 MB PDF)</span> is a play on <a
     href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>.&nbsp; I love the
     artwork on the shot of the Evil Mastermind as Morpheus sitting on the red
     leather chair.&nbsp; </li>
 <li ><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/ads/SGad5.pdf">Episode
     5</a> <span style='font-size:9.0pt'>(1.7 MB PDF)</span> alludes to <a
     href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>, one of my favorite
     movies.</li>
 <li >But I think <a
     href="http://www.sourcegear.com/ads/SGad4.pdf">Episode 4</a> <span
     style='font-size:9.0pt'>(1.8 MB PDF)</span> is my favorite comic of the
     ones we've released so far.&nbsp; The notion of implementing source control as
     a bunch of filing cabinets is just funny.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the problem with these one-page ads is the limited
space.&nbsp; Even though each ad is part of a 12-story arc, we also need each one to
be self-contained.&nbsp; Ever since we created this comic we have been wanting to do
a longer story.</p>

<p><img width=114 height=174 src="{{{link:id='2061'}}}"
align=right hspace=12>So we did.&nbsp; Next week at Tech-Ed, we'll be distributing a
comic book, 20 pages printed in full color.&nbsp; This one is just for fun.&nbsp; The
book contains some ads for SourceGear products, but the story itself has
nothing to do with version control.&nbsp; It's just a comic book adventure about The
Evil Mastermind and his geek minions on a special mission.</p>

<p>And for those of you who will not make it to Tech-Ed, you
can download the comic book <a

style='font-size:9.0pt'>(5.2 MB PDF)</span>.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
