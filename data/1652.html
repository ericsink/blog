<p>This week's episode of <a
href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=216">Dot Net Rocks</a>
features an interview with me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/">Martin Woodward</a>
tells me that "appearing on DNR is probably more impressive than going on
Letterman". From that remark, it's fairly straightforward to figure out how
much of a nerd Martin is.</p>

<p>Still, he has a point. As a guest on DNR, I find myself in
very good company. Recent guests include Billy Hollis, Raymond Chen, and Scott
Guthrie. Letterman's guests this week are Jake Gyllenhaal, John McCain and
Charles Grodin. Don't try and tell me you admire that second group more than
the first.</p>

<p>Last week's guest on Dot Net Rocks was Steve McConnell,
whose books are probably consuming more linear space on developers' bookshelves
than any other author on the planet. Several weeks ago when the <a
href="http://www.joltawards.com/2007/">Jolt finalists</a> were announced, I was
delighted to find my book nominated and simultaneously disappointed to find
that McConnell's latest book is one of my competitors. That's like being
nominated for an Oscar and finding out that Tom Hanks is one of the other
nominees.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to the DNR guys for inviting me to be on the
show.</p>

<p>Oh, and apologies in advance for the stuff I said in the
interview about Vista, Agile, Ruby, WPF/E, and CodeProject.com. Nothing
personal.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
