<P>The <A href="http://www.centralil.net/community/">Central Illinois .NET Users 
Group</A>&nbsp;has postponed tonight's meeting due to some kind of facilities 
problem.&nbsp; The meeting is being rescheduled for June 30th.&nbsp; I still 
plan to post a summary of my talk after the meeting has taken place.</P>
