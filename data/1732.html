<p>People want to be understood.&nbsp; That's why support groups are
so popular.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening I posted a comment on a <a
href="http://www.opticality.com/blog/">friend's blog</a>.&nbsp; Or rather, I <i>tried</i>
to post a comment.</p>

<p>True to my tendencies, it was really far too wordy to be
called a <i>comment</i>.&nbsp; I actually spent about half an hour wordsmithing a
multiple-paragraph response.</p>

<p>But when I hit the submit button to post it, Wordpress gave
me a generic error page.&nbsp; Presumably something timed out while I was crafting
my reply.</p>

<p>And when I hit the Back button, my comment was gone.&nbsp; <b>:-(</b></p>

<p>*&amp;%$#@!</p>

<p>My mind raced.&nbsp; What are my options here?</p>

<p>Maybe I should just re-type the whole thing?&nbsp; It was only
300 words or so.</p>

<p>Nah.&nbsp; The text I wrote was perfect.&nbsp; I probably won't be
able to remember it just the way it was.</p>

<p>And why should I have to?&nbsp; Firefox and Wordpress screwed
this up, not me!</p>

<p>Cautiously I hit the Forward button in my browser.&nbsp; Firefox
showed me this dialog:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=559 height=120
src="{{{link:id='2086'}}}"></p>

<p>Aha!&nbsp; I clicked OK.&nbsp; Wordpress coughed up the same hairball
I got before.</p>

<p>But now I know that Firefox still has my comment in memory
somewhere.&nbsp; All I have to do is figure out how to get it.</p>

<p>Two hours later I finally got my comment posted,
deliberately ignoring the fact that I could have retyped it ten times by then.</p>

<p>After several other attempts that brought me to dead ends,
here is the technique that succeeded:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I installed <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/">winpcap</a>
     and a packet sniffer, which I configured to capture all packets on my network
     interface.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Then I went back to my still-open instance of Firefox and
     hit Reload.&nbsp; I clicked the OK button in the dialog box above and Wordpress
     barfed again.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Then I went back to the packet sniffer and found the TCP
     connection containing my posted comment.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Ack!&nbsp; I had completely forgotten that the format would be <a
     href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</a>.&nbsp;
     Luckily, I memorized all of the punctuation marks in the ASCII table back
     when I was in middle school.&nbsp; %22 would be 34 in decimal, so that's a
     quotation mark.&nbsp; After several search-and-replace operations, all the
     escaped characters were fixed.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >During all this, I noticed and fixed a couple of typos I
     had previously missed.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Finally I went back to my friend's blog, pasted my comment
     into the textbox and hit submit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know that I'm not alone.&nbsp; Tell me the story of
something geeky that you did.</p>
