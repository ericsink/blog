<p>Yippee!&nbsp; I love it when a software product finally gets released.&nbsp; Just over a couple weeks ago we shipped Vault 3.0 and Dragnet 1.0.&nbsp; Today, we are releasing <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/downloads.html">SourceOffSite 4.1</a>.</p><p style="BORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5px; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; FONT-SIZE: smaller; FLOAT: right; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5px; MARGIN: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 50%; PADDING-TOP: 5px; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(230,230,230)">For those who don't know, SourceOffSite ("SOS") is an add-on product for users of SourceSafe ("VSS").&nbsp; The primary feature of SOS is that it provides remote access to a VSS database.&nbsp; VSS doesn't work well at all over the Internet.&nbsp; SOS solves that problem.</p>

<p>The primary new feature in 4.1 is integration with Dragnet, our bug-tracking product.&nbsp; The other big news is full support for Linux, Solaris and MacOS X.&nbsp;&nbsp;A surprising number of people need to access SourceSafe from Unix or Mac.&nbsp; We've had Unix support in the product for years, but at times we have allowed the Unix version to slip behind.&nbsp; Today we are treating Unix and MacOS like first-class citizens, simultaneously shipping them with the Windows release.</p>
<p>As many people know, I used to be a die-hard Mac user and advocate, complete with the defensiveness and chip on my shoulder that usually accompany the condition.&nbsp; <strong>;-)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I joined the Windows world circa 1995 when it got real 32-bit pointers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still really like Macintosh.&nbsp; I don't routinely use a Mac anymore, although MacOS X 10.3 makes me wish I did.&nbsp; Anyway, shipping SOS 4.1 on the Mac triggers a touch of nostalgia for me.&nbsp; This is the first MacOS product SourceGear has ever shipped.&nbsp; It will not be the last.</p>
