<p>People keep asking me why I haven't blogged about the
Microsoft acquisition of our Teamprise division.</p>

<p>Well, it's kind of complicated.</p>

<p>It all started three days before the signing of the deal
when my laptop died.&nbsp; And I mean it's really dead.&nbsp; It won't boot, from any
device.</p>

<p>Great timing, eh?</p>

<p>Fortunately, all I really needed for working on the deal was
email and Microsoft Word, so I just switched over to my netbook.</p>

<p>I completely forgot about the MacBrick Pro until this
weekend when I realized that the press coverage was going to hit Monday morning
and the only installation of my blogging software was trapped in a lifeless
piece of aluminum on my office floor.</p>

<p>So I ran out and bought a new Mac laptop, hoping to get
everything going in time to write my blog entry for Monday.</p>

<p>And then I figured, heck, as long as I was doing a
completely new setup, why not start off right with an Intel X-25M instead of
the stock hard disk?</p>

<p>Getting everything configured wasn't too difficult, but the SSD
ended up costing me a lot of time because Monday morning I had to tell the
other coders on my project team that I can do a full build in 24 seconds.&nbsp; All
that gloating killed a couple of hours, and by the time I got back to my desk I
figured I should check and see how the press coverage was going.</p>

<p>Whoa.&nbsp; The Microsoft PR machine is amazing!&nbsp; They got over
230 articles published about the acquisition.&nbsp; I couldn't get that kind of
press coverage without committing a felony.</p>

<p>Right about then I got into an argument with my daughter
because I wanted her to walk four blocks from her school over to my office and
she said it was too far.&nbsp; I wish my Mom would call me more often to tell me how
much she appreciates the fact that I was a model teenager who never caused my
parents any trouble.</p>

<p>So anyway, with hundreds of people already writing about the
deal, I needed a new angle.&nbsp; I figured I had to come up with something cool or
not post anything at all.&nbsp; So I started drafting something, but I got stuck
when I couldn't find anybody to confirm whether Kanye West jokes are still
funny or not.&nbsp; (Yo Eric!&nbsp; I'm really happy for you and I'mma let you finish,
but Groove was the greatest Microsoft acquisition of all time!)</p>

<p>A short time later our sales VP walked in to let me know
that SourceGear's name was mentioned in the "New York Freaking Times".&nbsp; Cool.</p>

<p>The next morning I resumed working on this blog entry, or
rather, on the infrastructure to support same.&nbsp; I restored the VMware image
from my Time Machine disk, but I couldn't get the product serial number to
work.&nbsp; So I figured maybe it was one of those stupid Snow Leopard bugs that
everybody is complaining about, and decided to upgrade to 10.6.2.&nbsp; But that
took hours, because apparently every Steve Jobs disciple on the planet was
upgrading their Mac on the same day, so Apple's download servers were really slow.</p>

<p>While I was doing that, the aforementioned daughter asked me
to drive her to the mall and I refused. &nbsp;So she walked FIVE MILES to get there
by herself.</p>

<p>Keep that in mind next time you're having trouble
understanding the mind of a teenager:&nbsp; FIVE MILES to the mall is a shorter walk
than FOUR BLOCKS to your Dad's office.</p>

<p>Suddenly I realized it had been a whole day since I told any
of my coworkers that I can build the whole tree in 24 SECONDS, and well, you
know what happened to the rest of my morning.</p>

<p>So then I walked across the street to the coffee shop to
pick up a copy of the local newspaper.&nbsp; As usual, they did a very nice job on
the press coverage for us.&nbsp; And, as usual, our story was below the fold because
the main story of the day was about farming.</p>

<p>Keep that in mind next time you're having trouble
understanding the mind of Champaign:&nbsp; If you want your big-time corporate
acquisition to be the top story, make sure you work something about corn yields
into the deal.</p>

<p>For those of you keeping score at home, that's 232 points
for the Microsoft PR team and one point for me.&nbsp; I'm sure there's some PR guy
at Microsoft trying to take credit for Don Dodson's piece in the Tuesday
morning edition of the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette, but that one was MINE.&nbsp; They
may be able to place stories in the New York Freaking Times, but I've got
connections too.</p>

<p>I'm not kidding -- building this project's code on some
machines can take several minutes, but my new Mac can do a whole build in 24
seconds.&nbsp; The X-25M is way cool.&nbsp; I am now seriously considering putting a $700
SSD into my $300 netbook.</p>

<p>This morning I gave up and paid VMware for a new serial
number, and here I am writing in my blog once again.</p>

<p>As I write this, the realization hits me.&nbsp; I got frustrated
because I couldn't move my VMware installation to my new machine.&nbsp; My company just
had a liquidity event.&nbsp; I could have paid VMware $79 to solve the problem, but
instead, I decided it would be better to thrash on that problem for three days
and THEN pay the $79.&nbsp; Yep, I'm in the big leagues now.</p>

<p>So anyway, if you haven't heard, Microsoft announced Monday
morning that it has acquired our Teamprise division.&nbsp; I think the deal ended up
being a nice win for both Microsoft and SourceGear.</p>

<p>I'll be at PDC next week.&nbsp; Stop by the SourceGear booth and
say hi.</p>
