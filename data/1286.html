<P>Near the bottom of my article on <A 
href="Abstraction_Pile.html">The .NET Abstraction 
Pile</A>, I mention that we've had some bad experiences with Java here at 
SourceGear.&nbsp; Yesterday I was pleasantly surprised when&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</A> linked my article (thanks 
Joel).&nbsp; Today my mailbox is filled with email from Java fans telling me my 
remarks were unfair and incorrect.</P>
<P>My opinions about Java were certainly not the real point of my article.&nbsp; 
I only mentioned our negative Java experiences as one example of how I have come 
to mistrust high-abstraction environments.&nbsp; But now that this can of worms 
has been opened, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;offer a few followup remarks:</P>
<P>First of all, if you're a Java fan, you probably should just not bother 
reading my stuff.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> I'm pretty much all about .NET now.&nbsp; I 
don't have the knowledge, the time or the desire&nbsp;to actually fight&nbsp;a 
.NET vs. Java war.</P>
<P>Yes, I know that .NET stands on the shoulders of Java.&nbsp; In fact, when I 
first saw C# presented at a DevelopMentor seminar, I was amazed at the 
similarities.&nbsp; It seems obvious that the C# team's kickoff meeting was very 
short:&nbsp; <EM>Hi everyone.&nbsp; Thanks for coming on such short 
notice.&nbsp; Go clone Java.&nbsp; Any questions?</EM></P>
<P>Yes, I know that a comparison of Java and .NET is an "apples-to-oranges" 
issue.&nbsp; After all, Java aims to be cross-platform and .NET (so far) does 
not.&nbsp; I recognize this as a big issue.&nbsp; I like .NET a lot, but even 
now I envy&nbsp;Java folks because SWT looks like it might actually be a viable 
technology for cross-platform UI development.</P>
<P>Everyone wants to know about the "projects which completely failed because 
Java was chosen".&nbsp; Very briefly, here's the scoop:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>One of them was a consulting project my company was doing for Arthur 
  Andersen.&nbsp; This project happened ages ago, around 1997.&nbsp; The UI was 
  done with Swing.&nbsp; Memory usage issues&nbsp;were a nightmare.&nbsp; The 
  killer bug was a problem which caused the JRE to crash whenever we tried to 
  print.&nbsp; Sun was openly acknowledging the bug and refusing to provide a 
  fix until JDK 1.1.7.&nbsp; By the time 1.1.7 was available, the decision to 
  kill the project had been made.&nbsp; I probably should have done this project 
  in VB.<BR><BR>
  <LI>The other "failed" project was the Motorola MAP phone.&nbsp; SourceGear 
  was one of many subcontractors involved in this project.&nbsp; We wrote two 
  browsers for this phone.&nbsp; The MAP environment was Java-based, apparently 
  using a hybrid of technologies from Sun and from a third-party somewhere in 
  England.&nbsp; In the end, the entire phone project was cancelled, 
  apparently&nbsp;because the performance and stability could not meet consumer 
  grade standards.&nbsp; I'm sure there were dozens of reasons why this project 
  failed.&nbsp; In my opinion, the choice of Java was <EM>one</EM> of those 
  reasons.</LI></UL>
<P>So if you're a Java fan, you are breathing a sigh of relief right now.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>"Oh good.&nbsp; Eric is clueless and his perspective on Java is years out 
  of date.&nbsp; Nothing to worry about here."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No problem.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> Like I said, slamming Java was not the point of 
my article.&nbsp; I've had some positive experience with C# and some negative 
experience with Java, but my experience is a pretty small dataset.&nbsp; Java 
today is probably a lot better than it was in 1997.&nbsp; Great.</P>
<P>Bottom line:&nbsp; The fact that my Java criticisms fall apart under close 
inspection does not invalidate the real points of my article:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Good&nbsp;technology decision making requires you to know what's going on 
  underneath the abstractions.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Really tall piles of abstractions should be treated with suspicion.&nbsp; 
  So far my experience with .NET has been a pleasant surprise, but a 
  <EM>really</EM> conservative ISV project manager today might still avoid C# 
  <EM>and</EM> Java in favor of C++.</LI></UL>
<P>By the way, not all of our Java experience has been negative.&nbsp; The <A 
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/">SourceOffSite</A> server is written in 
Java, and that product has been very successful for us.</P>
<P>Oh yeah, one more thing:&nbsp; Thanks to those who pointed out my mistake on 
UDP vs. IP.&nbsp; The article has been corrected.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
