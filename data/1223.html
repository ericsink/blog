I'm here at Microsoft PDC in Los Angeles.  The more I see of .NET, the more I like it.  Quite cool.<br><br>I saw Miguel de Icaza here this morning.  He's still very focused on the implementation of Mono (their .NET framework clone), and it sounds like it's going well.
So Hailstorm is now called .NET My Services.  Sorry Redmond, I don't like the name.  The concept remains cool, although it has bigger trust issues than normal shrinkwrap software.  I actually like the notion of having my calendar and contacts in a hosted location, accessible from anywhere.  It's a feature.  But if I don't trust that location, I don't get the feature.  Hailstorm asks for more of my trust than Outlook does.  I think I'm going to want to be sure that it delivers more coolness in exchange.
