<p>In October 2002, SourceGear was named one of the <a href="http://www.inc.com/app/inc500/viewCompany.jsp?cmpId=2002156">fastest growing</a> companies in the nation by Inc magazine. </p>
<p>By my original training, I am a software programmer. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois </a> at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>I founded the <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">AbiWord</a> project and was responsible for much of the original design and implementation.&nbsp; The title on my business card says "Software Craftsman". </p>
<p>Prior to founding SourceGear, I was at Spyglass (now part of OpenTV) for around five years. I served there as Project Lead for the browser team. We <a href="{{{link:id='1175'}}}">built</a> the original versions of the browser you now know as "Internet Explorer".</p><p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:eric@sourcegear.com">eric@sourcegear.com</a>.</p>
