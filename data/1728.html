<p>A couple weeks ago I started another one of my pet coding
projects.&nbsp; My regular readers know that use C# for basically everything.&nbsp;
However, for this project I decided to use Java and Eclipse.</p>

<p>I haven't written any Java code in several years.&nbsp; The JDK version
number back then was 1.1.7.&nbsp; My coding environments were Symantec Caf√©,
Supercede, and emacs.&nbsp; Refactoring was little more than the topic of Bill
Opdyke's dissertation (<a
href="ftp://st.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/papers/refactoring/opdyke-thesis.ps.Z">PostScript
file</a>).&nbsp; Eclipse was years away.</p>

<p>I figure it's time to refresh my perspective.</p>

<h3>Curly Braces</h3>

<p>My younger daughter sleepwalks.&nbsp; Every so often she gets up
in the middle of the night and starts wandering around.&nbsp; I'll find her
downstairs in the family room babbling about zoo animals.&nbsp; I take her back up
to bed.&nbsp; In the morning she doesn't remember a thing.&nbsp; Why does she do this?&nbsp; I
don't know, but I assume <i>anybody</i> would have trouble with their REM sleep
after watching two hours of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suite_Life_of_Zack_and_Cody">The Suite
Life of Zach and Cody</a>.</p>

<p>Or maybe it's hereditary.&nbsp; Apparently last week I got up in
the middle of the night, drove to O'Hare, flew to San Jose, took a cab to the
Sun headquarters, spit on their front lawn, came home and got back in bed.&nbsp; I
don't remember any of it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What I do know is that the first thing I noticed about Java this
time was that the curly braces are all on "the previous line", and my mental
health started to deteriorate very quickly after that.</p>

<p>Everything got better when I opened the Eclipse preferences
dialog and did this:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=399 height=363
src="{{{link:id='2078'}}}"></p>

<p>Oh, and this too:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=266 height=70
src="{{{link:id='2079'}}}"></p>

<p>These config changes made an amazing difference for me.&nbsp;
Apparently the default style in the Java world is to put the curly brace on the
same line as whatever precedes it.&nbsp; There's just no way I can get used to that.&nbsp;
I'm not saying my style is objectively better.&nbsp; I'm just saying that I can't
cope.</p>

<p>Luckily, the customization features of Eclipse are
fantastic.&nbsp; After making the changes above, I simply press "Ctrl-Shift-F" and
all my Java code looks a lot better to me.</p>

<p>I wish it worked outside the IDE.&nbsp; I've got <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596009208/sawdust08-20">Head
First Java</a> and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596007736/sawdust08-20">Java in a
Nutshell</a>.&nbsp; Both are excellent books, but I keep finding my left hand doing
the "Ctrl-Shift-F" motion hoping the page will reformat itself.</p>

<p>This morning on the way to work I saw somebody trying to
make a turn from the wrong lane.&nbsp; My left hand did "Ctrl-Shift-F".</p>

<h3>Key Bindings</h3>

<p>The excellent customization features of Eclipse came to the
rescue again for the issue of key bindings.&nbsp; Between Visual Studio and Eclipse,
everything is different.</p>

<p>For example, the three debugger commands I use most are
Debug, Step Over, and Step Into.&nbsp; </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >For Visual Studio, the default keys are F5, F10 and F11.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >For Eclipse, the default keys are F11, F6, and F5.</li>
</ul>

<p>Truth be told, I had to look up the Visual Studio key
bindings so I could type them above.&nbsp; I don't consciously know what they are.&nbsp;
I just have them buried somewhere in my unconscious mind.&nbsp; They're automatic.&nbsp; And
when I first tried debugging in Eclipse, things didn't work out so well.</p>

<p>In fact, all the key bindings in Visual Studio and Eclipse
are <i>so</i> different that I've been wondering if they're not intentionally
constructed that way for malevolent reasons.&nbsp; However, until I find a key that
means "Go to Declaration" in one environment and "Reformat my Hard Disk" in the
other, I'm going to set my suspicions aside and just assume that I'm being a
little too paranoid.</p>

<p>Still, I wonder what "Ctrl-Shift-F" does in Visual Studio?</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

<p>I normally don't like to do much customization of my work
environment.&nbsp; I am, after all, a Windows user.&nbsp; All my custom settings get lost
every time I repave.&nbsp; It's easier to just learn how to use things in their
default mode.</p>

<p>But if I'm going to use both Visual Studio and Eclipse, I
desperately need one of them to behave a bit more like the other.</p>
