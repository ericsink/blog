<p>I've been wondering if it's possible to serve a WPF browser
application from my Linux box.&nbsp; I found the <a
href="http://laurenlavoie.com/avalon/111">answer</a> on Lauren Lavoie's blog,
but I just had to try it for myself.</p>

<p>So I added the following five lines to the appropriate
VirtualHost section of my httpd.conf file:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New"'>AddType application/manifest .manifest<br>
AddType application/xaml+xml .xaml<br>
AddType application/x-ms-application .application<br>
AddType application/x-ms-xbap .xbap<br>
AddType application/octet-stream .deploy</span></p>

<p>Then I created a simple WPF browser and copied the resulting
files up to my web server.&nbsp; It worked!</p>

<p>Click <a href="http://sawdust.com/test/test.xbap">here</a>
to try it out.&nbsp; This is being served by Apache from my Linux server.&nbsp; You'll
need to have your desktop machine properly configured for running WPF
applications.&nbsp; This app was built with beta 2.</p>

<h3>For those who want more details...</h3>

<p>The source code for this simple xbap is <a
href="http://sawdust.com/test/ericsink_xbap_src.zip">here</a>.&nbsp; Here is how I
created it:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >First I told Visual Studio to create a new "WinFX Web
     Browser Application".&nbsp; (I'm still on beta 2, so I haven't made the name
     change to .NET 3.0 yet)</li>
 <li >Then I made several additions to Page1.xaml</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li >I added a label at the top so I would have a place to let
      the user know that the mouse does something.</li>
  <li >I added a toolbar so I would have a place to add a Print
      button.</li>
  <li >The ViewPort3D stuff is mostly copied from one of the WPF
      samples in the Windows SDK.</li>
  <li >The MeshGeometry3D data was the tricky part.&nbsp; I hacked
      the solid modeling code in my woodworking app to output triangles in XAML
      and pasted the result in here.</li>
 </ol>
 <li >Finally, I made some additions to Page1.cs</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li >I added a handler for the Print button.</li>
  <li >I pasted in the trackball code from <a
      href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/default.aspx">Daniel Lehenbauer</a>.</li>
  <li >I added code to create a trackball and hook it up to the
      camera and the light.</li>
 </ol>
</ol>
