<p>In July I will be giving a keynote address at <a
href="http://guadec.expectnation.com/public/content/keynotes">GUADEC</a>, the
annual GNOME conference, being held this year in Istanbul.</p>

<p>In September I will be speaking again at the <a
href="http://businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software</a> conference,
being held this year in Boston.</p>

<p>And finally, for something completely different, don't miss
the Jam Session at Tech-Ed on June 3<sup>rd</sup>.&nbsp; Several of us minions from
SourceGear are planning to take the stage and give our rendition of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Wizard">Pinball Wizard</a>.&nbsp; It'll
be me on acoustic guitar, our development manager <a
href="http://vaultblog.sourcegear.com/">Jeremy Sheeley</a> on bass, and our product
manager Paul Roub playing the <a
href="http://blog.roub.net/2008/02/the_evil_mastermind_guitars_you_heard_me.html">Evil
Mastermind Schecter PT</a> that will be given away later that week.</p>

<p>And BTW, none of us will be dressed as <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/TEM/index.html">The Evil Mastermind</a>.&nbsp; This
should be obvious, as The Evil Mastermind would never do something actually
cool like a song by The Who.&nbsp; Rather, he would do something like a Kelly
Clarkson song and mistakenly believe it was cool.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
