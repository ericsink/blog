buy a copy of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735623945/sawdust08-20">3D
Programming for Windows</a> by <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/">Charles
Petzold</a>.&nbsp; The book will be released tomorrow.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed the privilege of reading this book as a
technical reviewer.&nbsp; It's going to be very good.&nbsp; Not as good as Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows, but still, <i>very</i> good.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>The book contains 9 chapters:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li >Lights! Camera! Mesh Geometries!</li>
 <li >Transforms and Animation</li>
 <li >Axis/Angle Rotation</li>
 <li >Light and Shading</li>
 <li >Texture and Materials</li>
 <li >Algorithmic Mesh Geometries</li>
 <li >Matrix Transforms</li>
 <li >Quaternions</li>
 <li >Applications and Curiosa</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think anybody but Charles Petzold could have written
this book.&nbsp; He blends his development experience with his math background to
explain everything quite thoroughly, from the details of the API to the hows
and whys of the math underneath.&nbsp; </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >He explains why WPF 3D shades triangles differently
     depending on whether they share their vertices or not.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >His explanation of quaternions is probably the best I have
     read.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >He talks about why Viewport3DVisual is better than
     Viewport3D for printing.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >He explains the math behind lighting calculations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The book contains lots of pictures, lots of sample code and
a library of useful classes for WPF 3D programming.</p>

<p>If you're doing anything with WPF 3D, you simply <i>must</i>
have this book.</p>
