<p>I mostly bought an iPad just to see what the hype was all
about.&nbsp; I never expected to actually use it, for two reasons:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The iPad is a tweener, like a 6'5"" guy who wants to play power
     forward in the NBA.&nbsp; It's just the wrong size.&nbsp; There isn't enough space
     between my phone and my laptop for this thing.</li>
 <li >The iPad is just another character in the story Apple
     started telling back in 1985, "the computer for the rest of THEM".&nbsp; I
     think it's kind of cute that people who don't know how to deal with
     non-blocking socket I/O can still use the Web.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, even though this thing was not designed for me, after
two weeks with my iPad, I am surprised to admit that I really like it.</p>

<p>Surprised and a little embarrassed.&nbsp; This challenges my
geekhood.&nbsp; I mean really, what's wrong with me?&nbsp; The next thing you know I'll be
giving up my RPN calculator.&nbsp; Or using Finder instead of bash.&nbsp; How far is this
spiral toward normalcy going to go?</p>

<p>But I can't help it.&nbsp; The iPad is just really pleasant to
use:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >The email UI is nearly perfect.</li>
 <li >Using the web is far nicer than my Nexus One or my iPod
     Touch.&nbsp; The larger screen makes all the difference.</li>
 <li >It's really fast.&nbsp; Everything on my netbook feels like it
     moves at 1997 speeds.</li>
 <li >Instant-on is a critical feature.&nbsp; I hate waiting for my
     netbook to boot or unhibernate.</li>
 <li >Physically the iPad is a lot more convenient to grab than
     my laptop or even my netbook.&nbsp; It never feels unwieldy.</li>
 <li >The battery life is surprisingly good.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not that the iPad is perfect:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >I really need an openvpn client.</li>
 <li >Getting the mail client to talk with my IMAP server was
     harder than it should have been.</li>
 <li >I still haven't figured out how to make the calendar app
     sync with Google Apps for my domain.</li>
 <li >I want Flash.</li>
 <li >Nobody has the Apple iPad Case in stock, and I really want
     one.&nbsp; This isn't really a criticism of the device itself, but it's really
     exasperating and I want to vent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, for me the iPad is one of those anomalies of
theory and practice.&nbsp; In theory, I should hate this thing.&nbsp; In practice, it
competes with four other excellent devices for my attention, and it wins a lot.</p>
