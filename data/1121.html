<p>The release of a software product is so very satisfying.&nbsp; The software product cycle is a little like a pregnancy I suppose.&nbsp; The first few months are easy, even enjoyable.&nbsp; The last few weeks are mostly discomfort and pain.&nbsp; But then, the product is finally "born", and the world suddenly seems to make sense again.</p>
<p>But I digress...</p>
<p>I am very pleased to announce the 3.0 release of <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/index.html">Vault</a>, as well as the 1.0 release of its little sister, <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/dragnet/index.html">Dragnet</a>.&nbsp; Both products were released today, after what has <em>seemed</em> like an eternity of discomfort and pain.</p>
<p>Some of you are still awaiting the next release of <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/sos/index.html">SourceOffSite</a> (which I guess is Vault's older brother).&nbsp; Unfortunately, SourceOffSite 4.1 is not quite ready.&nbsp; The primary new features in 4.1 are support for integration with Dragnet and updates to the Linux and MacOS ports.&nbsp; This product should be ready for release before Christmas.</p>
<p>I won't repeat the list of new stuff in Vault 3.0 I posted <a href="{{{link:id='1122'}}}">before</a>, but I will repeat the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can't go back</strong>.&nbsp; Installing Vault 3.0 will upgrade your Vault database to 3.0, and there is no way to go back.&nbsp; The state files on your client will be changed to a new format as well, and there is no way to go back.&nbsp; Upgrading to 3.0 is a one-way trip.
</li>
<li><strong>You can't mix and match</strong>.&nbsp; Vault 3.0 clients will not talk with Vault 2.0 servers.&nbsp; Vault 3.0 servers will not talk with Vault 2.0 clients.&nbsp; Everyone will have to upgrade, all at once.
</li>
<li><strong>You should not use .NET 2.0</strong>.&nbsp; Right now, Vault 3.0 is only supported and compatible with the current shipping release of the .NET Framework.&nbsp; If you are using the .NET 2.0 betas, you should not use this release of Vault.&nbsp; (Yes, we will test and verify with .NET 2.0 later.)
</li>
<li><strong>You should do backups</strong>.&nbsp; Please, before you do the upgrade, backup your data and put the backup in a safe place.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daily backups are a darn good idea anyway, so once you've started the habit, keep it.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hopefully now I can put a bit more attention to my writing again.&nbsp; I have a deadline for MSDN on Friday, and I've been promising new chapters of my <a href="{{{link:id='1079'}}}">Source Control HOWTO</a> for several weeks now.</p>
