<p>For about a half hour yesterday, productivity at
SourceGear/Teamprise World Headquarters came to a grinding halt.&nbsp; The weather
has been fantastic, so we've been opening our windows.&nbsp; Looking down from our
fourth floor view, somebody noticed a convertible parked at the coffee shop
across the street:</p>

<p>Look closely at what is sitting in the back seat:</p>

<p><img width=324 height=392 src="{{{link:id='2075'}}}"></p>

<p>Yep, that's a Mac notebook, just sitting there waiting for
somebody to carry it away.</p>

<p>So of course, we had to watch and see what happened.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>One person here suggested we go down and attach a sticky
note that says, "Lucky for you, I prefer Windows."</p>

<p>Amazingly, nobody lifted the laptop.&nbsp; The owner left the car
and its contents unattended for around 20 or 30 minutes before he returned and
drove away.</p>

<p>Actually, I should say that we are <i>assuming</i> that this
guy was in fact the owner of the car.&nbsp; If not, I suppose he's a thief rather
than a fool.</p>
