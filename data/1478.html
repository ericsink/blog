<P>Call me a fan of the <A 
href="http://www.red-gate.com/code_profiling.htm">Ants Profiler</A> from Red 
Gate Software.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Our top priority at SourceGear right now is making Vault faster.&nbsp; I 
don't get to do much coding these days, so I decided to get my hands dirty and 
pitch in.&nbsp; Several of the other folks here have been using Ants to profile 
Vault, so I thought I would give it a try.&nbsp; The tool was extremely 
smooth.&nbsp; I installed it with no problems.&nbsp; I didn't read a word of the 
documentation.&nbsp; I launched the profiler and told it to profile the Vault 
GUI client EXE.&nbsp; I did my test and exited the Vault client.&nbsp; Ants 
showed me the results.</P>
<P>The results browser is cool.&nbsp; I cruised around the various functions and 
examined the timings.&nbsp; Soon I discovered one of those problems which 
profilers were born to find:&nbsp; The .NET RichTextBox class is really, really 
slow.</P>
<P>We use a RichTextBox to display user messages in a pane at the bottom of the 
Vault client window.&nbsp; I suppose any plain text box would suffice, but we do 
use a little bit of color for highlighting errors in red.&nbsp; Anyway, the 
profiler was showing that Vault spends an obscene amount of time showing user 
progress messages.&nbsp; My test case involved the retrieval of 6,000 files from 
a repository, which means I was adding 6,000 messages to that RichTextBox.</P>
<P>At first I suspected string concatenation.&nbsp; The code to append messages 
looked something like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><FONT 
  face="Courier New,Courier,monospace">AppendText("["+msg.When+"] "+</FONT><FONT 
  face="Courier New,Courier,monospace">msg.Message+"\r\n");</FONT></STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>So I 
changed it to eliminate the string concatenation:</FONT></FONT><FONT size=3></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT face="Courier New,Courier,monospace" 
  size=2><STRONG>AppendText("[");<BR>AppendText(msg.When);<BR>AppendText("] 
  ");<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Courier New,Courier,monospace" 
  size=2><STRONG>AppendText(msg.Message);<BR>AppendText("\r\n");</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">This made no real difference in 
performance, but the profiler results&nbsp;became even more useful.&nbsp; Ants 
can show how much time is being spent on each line of code.&nbsp; When I broke 
things up, Ants reported that the first four calls to AppendText were fast, and 
the fifth one was slow.&nbsp; Then I realized what's going on.&nbsp; When you 
append&nbsp;a CRLF&nbsp;to the RichTextBox, it's re-running its internal layout 
algorithm.</FONT></P>
<P>RichTextBox is obviously overkill for the way we are using it.&nbsp; It's not 
like we need full justification or embedded&nbsp;tables in our user messages 
pane, but we're paying for these features in performance.&nbsp; This 
innocent-looking&nbsp;piece of the .NET framework is actually a word 
processor.</P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">The problem was easily fixed.&nbsp; 
Instead of calling AppendText() on every single message,&nbsp;I batched up the 
non-urgent messages into groups so we could append them with a single 
call.&nbsp; Much faster, no lost functionality, everybody will be 
happier.</FONT></P></FONT></FONT>
