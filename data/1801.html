<p>Veracity 0.9.1 is available.</p>

<p>This release is a big milestone -- it is the first release
which we are identifying as "ready to use".</p>

<p>Even though we have been dogfooding Veracity for over a
year, each release has been accompanied by verbiage which discouraged people
from relying upon it.&nbsp; This was mostly because we thought we might still change
a repository storage format in ways that might not be backward compatible. Well,
we have finally decided that this hesitation is no longer necessary. All future
releases of Veracity will be compatible with a repository created with version
0.9.1.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 is coming very soon.&nbsp; In fact, we considered
blessing this build with the magical "1.0" designation.&nbsp; But we decided to do a
little more polishing and make 1.0 happen during the week of <a
href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011">OSCON</a> at the end of this month.</p>

<p>The Veracity home page is:</p>

<p>The front page contains a comparison chart which I <i>hope</i>
will be perceived simply as a way of describing Veracity's place in the world
relative to other things.&nbsp; I don't want this triggering a flame war with people
quibbling over details while they argue which DVCS is the best.</p>

<p>Available <a href="http://veracity-scm.com/downloads.html">downloads</a>
include the source code as well as packaged builds for Windows, Mac and Ubuntu
Linux.</p>

<p>At the moment, you cannot push to the public server.&nbsp; We
haven't done the homework necessary to let us accept patches and contributed
code from the community.&nbsp; We will get all our ducks in a row as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Finally, veracity-scm.com includes a <a

Veracity, this is the place.&nbsp; We've thrown a few seed questions in to get
things started.</p>
