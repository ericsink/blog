<p>Last week's beta 2 release means that the long-awaited version
5.0 of SourceGear Vault is coming soon.&nbsp; This includes the regular edition of
Vault as well as the "much more better" edition which has integrated
bug-tracking.&nbsp; (The latter product is actually called SourceGear Fortress and
carries the version number 2.0, but its heart is still Vault.)</p>

<p>This release has numerous improvements, but for now I want
to highlight one new feature which we call "VSS Handoff".&nbsp; Basically, Handoff
is a simpler and faster way of importing a SourceSafe database.&nbsp; Instead of
converting all your old history, Vault simply wraps your VSS database and makes
it part of your Vault repository.&nbsp; After that, all new checkins will go into
the regular Vault database.&nbsp; For history operations which need to access stuff
that happened before the Handoff, the VSS database is seamlessly referenced.&nbsp;
The transition from SourceSafe can't get more painless than this.</p>

<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; If you are still using SourceSafe, Vault 5
will remove your last excuse.</p>

<p>In fact, shortly after Vault 5 is released, I plan to go on
a world tour.&nbsp; If you are still clinging to SourceSafe, I will visit your
office.&nbsp; I will taunt you mercilessly and suggest an MRI to confirm that there
is nothing between your ears but bone.&nbsp; And I will drench you with my new <a

Soaker Max Infusion Flash Flood Water Blaster</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I will be morally justified.&nbsp; You've been given many
opportunities to switch to any one of several dozen competent version control
tools.&nbsp; And yet, it's 2009 and you're still using SourceSafe.&nbsp; Surely you
didn't expect this to end well?</p>
