<p>How embarrassing!&nbsp; Roland Boon found a <a href="http://rolandboon.net/WSBeanRSS/Weblog.aspx?day=2004-12-15/3">silly bug</a> in the sample code in the MSDN article I posted yesterday.&nbsp; (I used a variable which was no longer in scope.)</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to all of us.&nbsp; Even in fake code, always make sure it compiles before you check it in.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
