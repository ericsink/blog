<p>In the busy-ness of the holiday season you may have missed
the quiet passing of Dr. Dobb's Journal.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The official story is that the magazine is evolving into a
section within InformationWeek, but that's just spin.&nbsp; Dr. Dobb's is <a

align=right hspace=12>I suppose this was inevitable.&nbsp; I've been writing for
several years about the decline of print publications for developers.&nbsp; Like
most of them, this one has been looking thin and sickly for quite some time.&nbsp;
Sadder still, their final issue featured a huge grammatical error on the front
cover.&nbsp; I'm sure this was not the way the DDJ staff wanted things to end.</p>

<p>Still, the passing of this magazine is rather historic for
our young industry.&nbsp; Dr. Dobb's first started publication in 1976, about the
same time that Microsoft and Apple were founded.&nbsp; A significant slice of
today's programmers weren't even born yet.&nbsp; For many people, the last few years
of 64-page issues are all they have ever seen of DDJ.&nbsp; They don't remember that
Dr. Dobb's Journal was a pretty great magazine back in its day.</p>

<p>It really was.</p>
