<p>Does anybody remember when magazines used to put the table of contents just inside the front cover?&nbsp; That's where readers expect it to be, even though I can't remember the last time I saw one there.</p>
<p>Apparently one day somebody in the advertising department realized they were missing a huge opportunity.&nbsp; Since readers automatically turn to the inside front cover to see the table of contents, that's a perfect place to put an ad and charge the advertiser extra for "premium placement".</p>
<p>At first I was annoyed with this, but I quickly learned to just turn one extra page.&nbsp; No biggie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then some bozo decided to put yet <strong>another</strong> ad before the table of contents.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; After all, the algorithm can be generalized:&nbsp; Wherever the reader expects the table of contents to be, just put an ad there.</p>
<p>Where will the madness stop?&nbsp; Is there a limit to how much magazines are willing to annoy their readers to please their advertisers?</p>
<p>I don't know, but in this week's edition of Fortune magazine, the table of contents is on page 17.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">R.I.P. Software Legends</font></strong></p>
<p>It is with much sadness that I report the apparent passing of the <a href="http://www.softwarelegends.com/">Software Legends</a> website.&nbsp; I'm not sure when it happened, but sometime recently the site just disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose I can't blame them for removing it.&nbsp; That particular ad campaign was over a long time ago.&nbsp; The only good reason to leave the site active would be to make sure that people who see my <a href="http://www.notalegend.com/">parody site</a> will get the joke.</p>
<p>Maybe someday Microsoft will come up with another campaign suitable for satire.&nbsp; This one was a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Now all I need is an Xbox</font></strong></p>
<p>Speaking of actual legends, I recently had the honor of exchanging a couple emails with Alexander Seropian, founder of Bungie, maker of really cool games.&nbsp; Seropian has a <a href="http://www.wideload.com/">new startup</a> now.&nbsp; He offered to trade me few copies of Halo 2 for a few a copies of our stuff.&nbsp; I wonder if Best Buy has Xboxes in stock at this time of year?</p>
<p>By the way, for those of you wondering, SourceGear's current policy on trades is as follows:&nbsp; If you have a product as cool as Halo 2, we'll be happy to trade.&nbsp; Everybody else pays cash.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
