<P>People say that Microsoft is a bad partner.  In fact, I'd have to 
confess that I myself have said that, on certain occasions. <img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>I recently got a call from somebody at Microsoft's field office in 
Chicago.  They had a customer who was unhappy with SourceSafe, and they 
asked me to go with them to visit that customer and try to convince them to 
switch to Vault.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  Microsoft asked me to help them sell my product.  In 
my book, that's pretty darn good partnering.  If this continues, I'm 
obviously going to have to take back all those horrible things I've said about 
Microsoft. <img src="smiley.gif"></P>
