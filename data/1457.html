<P>Heh.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/">Phillip Pearson</A> gives 
CornSharp <A href="http://dev.myelin.co.nz/corn/20030512.html">a try</A>, and 
wants to know if I will release source code.&nbsp; I've had several other 
requests for the source as well.&nbsp; In principle, I have no real objection to 
giving the source away.&nbsp; I have no intention of trying to make money with 
this app.&nbsp; However, there may be practical obstacles.</P>
<P>The primary problem is that CornSharp uses one commercial third party 
component (the SSH feature), and I'm thinking about using another one (a better 
WYSIWYG editor).&nbsp; I might be able to separate those pieces into plugins and 
release the remainder.&nbsp; This is only likely to happen if I get around to 
it.&nbsp; I have a day job, so CornSharp gets my attention in randomly scheduled 
bursts.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I <EM>do</EM> plan to continue improving CornSharp, because I use it every 
day, and it's pretty darn lame.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"> </P>
