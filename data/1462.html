<P>I am here in Dallas for TechEd.&nbsp; Right now I'm blogging&nbsp;over a fast 
WiFi connection&nbsp;in the lobby of a stunning hotel.&nbsp; The walls are 
thirty feet tall and covered with solid raised wood panels.&nbsp; The tapestries 
are enormous.&nbsp; There is a Starbucks approximately a 9-iron away from 
here.&nbsp; Life is very good.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
