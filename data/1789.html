<p>Several folks have asked for a copy of the slides from my
talk at OSCON last week, so <a
href="{{{link:id='1790'}}}">here they are</a> (PDF, 2
MB).&nbsp; They might be a little hard to follow without the narrative that goes
with them.&nbsp; A videotape of the talk will be posted in a week or so.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who attended my presentation.&nbsp; The turnout was
great, and folks seemed quite enthusiastic about Veracity.</p>

<p>My apologies to the <a href="http://syncwith.us/">Prophet
and SD</a> developers (one of whom attended my talk) for neglecting to mention
them.&nbsp; A silly oversight on my part.</p>

<p>I was especially appreciative of the attendance and
expressions of support from several members of the original Subversion
development team.&nbsp; Subversion is one of the most successful version control
tools ever, and I watched its early development closely enough to develop an
admiration for the folks who built it.&nbsp; So it was a very pleasant surprise to
find a few "celebrities" in attendance at my session.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
