<p>People usually think of SourceGear as "Eric Sink's company",
but that's only half true.&nbsp; My business partner Corey Steffen has the same
ownership that I do -- he's just not as loud as I am.</p>

<p>Because Corey is sort of quiet, most people don't know much
about him.&nbsp; Here's a piece of information that I think is interesting:&nbsp; Corey
is an amateur farmer on the side.</p>

<p>Yep, Corey spends his days running a software company and
his off hours running a small farm.&nbsp; So he comes to work with stories about
chickens and sheep and horses and pastures.&nbsp; Oh my.</p>

<p>(It is interesting to note that <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/">Brian Harry</a>, creator of SourceSafe and
Team Foundation Server, also has a <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/03/11/end-of-week-2-on-the-farm.aspx">passion
for farming</a>.&nbsp; So Corey and Brian are two data points that suggest some sort
of a pattern involving version control and agriculture, but I dare not try to
extrapolate.)</p>

<p>Anyway, since Corey's life is such an odd juxtaposition of
two extremely different pastimes, folks here at the company tend to make the
occasional joke about it.&nbsp; In fact, Corey has been the recipient of merciless
but harmless teasing here for over a decade now.&nbsp; For some reason, the subject
just never gets old.&nbsp; When we get together for our company lunch on Wednesdays,
a joke about Corey getting up at 4:30am to clean out the horse stalls before he
comes to the office to clean out the bug database is probably a sure laugh.</p>

<p>Continuing in this fine tradition, one of our guys recently
found the following promotional card and brought it in for a quick joke at
Corey's expense:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p>"Hey Corey, I thought of you when I saw this magazine.&nbsp;
Maybe you should pick up a copy?"</p>

<p>That was funny.</p>

<p>And it got even funnier two seconds later when Corey
admitted that he was already a subscriber.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The next day, he brought in his copy of the most recent
issue:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=294 height=384 src="{{{link:id='2100'}}}"></p>

<p>I would like to be able to say that I took this in stride.&nbsp;
After all, I've known for years that Corey keeps chickens.&nbsp; I still remember
back in 1997 when Corey joined the company he told me that his chickens provide
them with 18 eggs every morning.</p>

<p>How does a family make use of 18 fresh eggs EVERY SINGLE
MORNING?</p>

<p>Anyway, seeing this magazine left me speechless.&nbsp; In part I
was surprised by yet another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Acres">Green
Acres</a> moment from Corey.</p>

<p>But mostly I was just shocked that this magazine exists.&nbsp; I
mean really.&nbsp; An entire print publication for people who raise chickens as a
hobby?&nbsp; That's what I call a niche.&nbsp; How does the publisher survive?</p>

<p>More to the point, how can this magazine be successful when <a
href="http://www.ddj.com/">Dr. Dobb's</a> looks like it might be pushing up
daisies sometime before the World Series is over? &nbsp;Dr. Dobbs is arguably the
most prestigious developer magazine in our industry, but it hasn't been looking
any too healthy over the last year or so.</p>

<p>It's gotta be all about market penetration:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >In very rough and round figures, there are 3 million
     software developers in the United States and 1% of them are subscribers to
     Dr. Dobbs.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >I have no idea how many people raise poultry in their
     backyard, but I suspect my freshman chemistry class had more people.&nbsp;
     However many it is, I bet well over 50% of them are subscribers to the
     magazine shown above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most software developers no longer use content in paper
form.</p>

<p>Andy Brice recently <a
href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2008/09/17/the-realities-of-software-book-publishing/">commented</a>
on the poor sales of Charles Petzold's book on WPF 3D.&nbsp; This is another sign of
the major shift in our industry.&nbsp; Petzold was maybe the last of his breed.&nbsp;
Most authors gave up years ago on the idea that they could make a living from
writing alone.&nbsp; Until quite recently, Petzold was one of the few who still did,
and now even that appears to be changing.</p>

<p>Software development magazines and books are dying.&nbsp; You
already know this.&nbsp; I already know this.&nbsp; But I continue to be amazed at the
pace of this change.&nbsp; People resist change.&nbsp; Billions of dollars of VC money
has been lost by overestimating the willingness of people to embrace change.&nbsp;
In this case, I have underestimated it.&nbsp; Looking ahead ten more years, I wonder
how much smaller the "Computers" section at my local Borders bookstore will be.</p>

<p>They'll probably just fill the extra space with a bunch of
titles about backyard livestock management.</p>
