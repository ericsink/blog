
<p>I'm writing this blog entry to share an exciting bit of news from
SourceGear:&nbsp; We have decided to announce the fact that we are
developing a new product which will be released later this year.&nbsp;  The code-name
for this new product is "Allerton".&nbsp;  In a nutshell, Allerton is a
Linux/Solaris/MacOS client for Team Foundation.  </p>
<h4>What is Team Foundation?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>A bit of background: With Visual Studio 2005, Microsoft will be
introducing a suite of new tools called <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/">Visual Studio Team System</a>
targeted especially at enterprise customers.  Team Foundation is the
server component which offers source control and work item tracking as
part of Visual Studio Team System.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Why would anybody need a non-Windows client?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>The primary client for Team Foundation is Visual Studio itself, but
that obviously runs only on Windows.  If you have even one person who
needs to access source control or work item tracking from a
non-Windows platform, this is a big problem.  In large enterprise
environments, this is not only a big problem, it is a common one.</p>
<p>To address this need, we are building tools which allow users on
Linux/Solaris/MacOS to access the source control and work item
tracking features of Team Foundation.  &nbsp; The Allerton product will
include a rich GUI client, a command-line client, and support for
integration with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>How much will Allerton cost?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Pricing for this product has not yet been announced.  &nbsp; Don't ask me about it.
&nbsp; I'm not saying anything until we make an official announcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When will this product ship?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>We plan to release Allerton later this year in the same time frame as
Visual Studio 2005.  &nbsp; We will demo the product at our booth at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2005/default.mspx">Tech-Ed</a>
in June.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Isn't this a big change in SourceGear's strategy?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>No.  &nbsp; SourceGear has two main products, SourceOffSite and Vault.  &nbsp; These
two products are very different.  One is a SourceSafe add-on, and the
other is a SourceSafe replacement.  Vault and SourceOffSite are very
distinct.  &nbsp; They are developed by two different teams.</p>
<p>It may seem goofy for the company who makes Vault to develop an add-on product for somebody else's source control tool.&nbsp; But Allerton is the next logical step for the SourceOffSite side of our
company.&nbsp;  Just as SourceOffSite is an add-on for SourceSafe, Allerton
is an add-on for Team Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Does this mean you are giving up on Vault?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Heck no.&nbsp;  The Vault team is busy working on the
next release.&nbsp;  Vault's momentum is strong and growing.&nbsp;  December 2004 was a record month for SourceGear revenue, and it was the first month that
Vault sales beat SourceOffSite sales.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Doesn't Team Foundation compete with Vault?  By building Allerton,
aren't you consorting with the enemy?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>The positioning of Team Foundation and Vault will
be so different that the sense of competition between them will be a
lot less than you think.  &nbsp; Compared to Vault, Team Foundation will be much larger and much more expensive.&nbsp; Team Foundation will be most popular in large enterprise scenarios with hundreds of developers.&nbsp; Vault is very popular in the "professional developer" market segment where teams typically have less than 100 developers.</p>
<p>I believe Team Foundation will succeed.&nbsp; I believe Vault will continue to succeed.&nbsp; I also believe Perforce, AccuRev, and Subversion will continue to succeed.&nbsp; The source control market is very
fragmented, with lots of profitable and popular products.  That won't change
anytime soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>No, really, why are you doing this Allerton thing?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>For the money!&nbsp;  As a private company, we don't publicly disclose our
revenue numbers, but trust me on this -- SourceOffSite makes a lot of
money.  &nbsp; This product has made me a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/software.aspx">believer</a> in the strategy of
building add-ons for popular products.</p>
<p>It may take a long time, but eventually Team Foundation is going to
become a popular product.&nbsp;  Some ISV is going to make a boatload of money
selling Unix clients for it.  &nbsp; It seems silly to think about that money
going to somebody else.  &nbsp; Our experience with SourceOffSite makes
SourceGear the natural company for the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>But I heard somewhere that companies are supposed to be focused.&nbsp; Doesn't this dilute SourceGear's focus?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>If you think Allerton is a change of focus for us, that is only because you have no idea how much time I've spent thinking about the opportunities in software for woodworkers.&nbsp; <strong>:-)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Where does the name "Allerton" come from?</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><a href="http://www.allerton.uiuc.edu/">Allerton Park</a> is a really cool place, not too far from SourceGear's office.&nbsp; If you hate this code-name, don't worry -- it's just a placeholder to be used until we figure out the real product name.</p>
