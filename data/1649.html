<p>With a person, it's pretty simple.&nbsp; There usually isn't much
ambiguity in specifying the birth date of a human being.&nbsp; I was born on March
15<sup>th</sup>, and that's the date I celebrate every year.&nbsp; Nobody has ever
tried to suggest that I should celebrate some other day.</p>

<p>With a company, it's a bit more complicated.&nbsp; There are several
dates we could choose for the purpose of annually marking the advancing age of
our auspicious assembly:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >In 2004 we restructured the company from a C corporation
     to an LLC.</li>
 <li >In 2000, we changed the name to SourceGear.</li>
 <li >In summer of 1997, we incorporated.</li>
 <li >Around April of 1997, the company hired its first
     employee.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose there are valid reasons for celebrating any of the
above birthdays.&nbsp; But the birthday I have always celebrated for SourceGear is
today, January 7<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; It was on this day in 1997, ten years ago, that
I took possession of my first office space.&nbsp; That's the day I consider this
company to have been founded.</p>
