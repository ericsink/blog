<P>I like to periodically look at what's going on within other developer 
communities.&nbsp; I obviously spend most of my time in the .NET world, but it 
is always good to have a broader perspective.&nbsp; It's been a long time since 
I looked seriously at the Java community.&nbsp; We were very serious about Java 
once, but that was a long time ago.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>I believe strongly that a group's potential is eventually limited by the 
  strength of its leadership.&nbsp; I'm an outsider, but it still looks to me 
  like the leadership in the Java world is Fouled Up Beyond ALL 
  Recognition.&nbsp; Java ISVs don't know whether to listen to <A 
  href="http://www.sun.com/">Mom</A> or <A 
  href="http://www.ibm.com/">Dad</A>.&nbsp; Everybody knows IBM should just buy 
  Sun and clean up the mess.&nbsp; When are they going to do it?<BR><BR>
  <LI>I downloaded <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</A> 
  yesterday.&nbsp; At first I was shocked when I saw the download is 84 
  MB.&nbsp; Then I realized that's about four percent of the size of Visual 
  Studio.&nbsp; I gotta recalibrate.&nbsp; I think I'm several years behind the 
  curve in&nbsp;the way I think about the size of apps.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It's really cool that one of the leading Java IDEs is made by a <A 
  href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">small ISV</A>.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It looks like&nbsp;weblogs have some <A 
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/">real</A> <A 
  href="http://www.javablogs.com/">traction</A> in the Java world.&nbsp; 
  Neato.&nbsp; I've subscribed to a few.<BR><BR>
  <LI>It is interesting to note that there are <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/jugs/">Java user groups</A>.&nbsp; However, there 
  seems to be something missing when I compare this to <A 
  href="http://www.ineta.org/">INETA</A>.&nbsp; Passion, perhaps?<BR><BR>
  <LI>Maybe this perspective is outdated, but I still think of Java as being 
  strong on the server and lame on the desktop.&nbsp; SWT looks like the right 
  kind of answer.&nbsp; Does <A href="http://www.wx4j.org/">wx4j</A> have any 
  traction in the Java world?&nbsp; I love cross-platform development, so I've 
  always wished I had a problem for which <A 
  href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</A> could be the solution.<BR><BR>
  <LI>I remember the JClass library from KL Group.&nbsp; Oops, I see they're now 
  called Sitraka.&nbsp; Oops, I see they're now called <A 
  href="http://www.quest.com/">Quest Software</A>, apparently by way of an 
  acquisition.</LI></UL>
<P>I wish I was going to <A href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne</A> at 
the end of this month.&nbsp; There's nothing like a trade show as a way to take 
the pulse of a developer community.&nbsp; In the past, this event has drawn 
around 25,000 attendees.&nbsp; That's over twice the size of 
Tech-Ed!<BR><BR></P>
