<p>Until about 2002 I had a broad disdain for most IDEs.&nbsp; I
just felt they were too <i>pushy</i>.&nbsp; They were always trying to take control
over my build system or the layout of my source tree.&nbsp; If I'm going to give
those things up, I want something in return.&nbsp; For a long time, the tradeoff
never seemed fair.&nbsp; THINK C on the Macintosh was one of the only IDE products I
actually liked.</p>

<p>Visual Studio .NET 2002 was the first Windows IDE that won
me over.&nbsp; I still use vi or emacs almost every day, but I'll admit that I now use
Visual Studio more.</p>

<p>Last year I switched to Visual Studio 2005, and I love it.&nbsp;
This is a product that is so perfect I worry about its next release.&nbsp; Now that
Visual Studio 2008 is out, I'll probably give it a try at some point soon.&nbsp; But
Visual Studio 2005 is sort of like "if it works, don't mess with it".&nbsp; The last
thing I want is for them to screw it up, and I can't really <i>imagine</i> how
it could be better.</p>

<p>I guess when it comes to IDEs, I'm just not very
imaginative.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>I started using Eclipse a few weeks ago, and now I
understand a bit more about where Visual Studio has room to improve.&nbsp; I think
Eclipse is amazing, and I've barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>So anyway, here are a couple of my current favorite Eclipse
features:</p>

<h3>Constant Builds</h3>

<p>When I first installed Eclipse, the very first thing I did
was look for the menu item to start a build.&nbsp; When I didn't find one, I assumed
that the Eclipse menu system must be too cluttered and counterintuitive.&nbsp; How
could they make such a frequently-used command so hard to find?</p>

<p><img width=242 height=95 src="{{{link:id='2081'}}}"
align=right hspace=12>Of course I now understand that Eclipse has no build
command because it is automatically building all the time.&nbsp; In fact, I've
quickly become rather hooked on this feature.&nbsp; I once got it confused, but
mostly it Just Works.&nbsp; I make code changes, save the file, and the Problems
pane automatically shows all the current warnings and errors.&nbsp; Sweet.</p>

<p>In fact, this morning I fired up Visual Studio 2005 to fix a
bug.&nbsp; After making the code change, I saved the file and just stared at the
bottom of my screen, waiting for the compile.&nbsp; A few seconds later I realized I
had to press Ctrl-Shift-B.</p>

<h3>Quick-Fix</h3>

<p>I really like the Quick Fix feature of Eclipse.&nbsp; Basically,
whenever I have a compile error or warning, I put the insertion point into the
offending text and press Ctrl-1.&nbsp; This invokes the Quick Fix facility, which
pops up a little window showing options to automatically fix the problem.&nbsp; For
example, if I am trying to call a method that doesn't exist, it offers to
create the missing method.</p>

<p><img width=575 height=144 src="{{{link:id='2082'}}}">Visual
Studio has similar features (Generate Method Stub, for example), but Quick Fix
seems more creative.&nbsp; It almost always offers me several choices for how to
resolve the situation, plus a preview of what the Quick Fix will look like.</p>

<p>This is particularly handy for dealing with exceptions.&nbsp; I
mostly dislike the way Java forces me to declare which exceptions a method
might throw.&nbsp; Ctrl-1 gives me a quick way to either add a throws declaration or
a try/catch.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

<p>I am obviously an Eclipse newbie, so my explanations of its
features are probably wrong.&nbsp; And like I said, I'm just getting started.&nbsp; As I
was writing this blog entry, I discovered "Generate Constructor Using Fields..."&nbsp;
I sure I wish I had found<i> that </i>one earlier.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Anyway, feel free to correct me or tell me what I missed or
remind me that I'm clueless or tell me 7 reasons why I should be using
IntelliJ.</p>

<p>But mostly I'm just saying that the experience of using
Eclipse has given me a much bigger perspective on IDEs in general.&nbsp; In
comparing Visual Studio and Eclipse, I can't really say whether one is clearly
better than the other.&nbsp; Mostly I get the impression that these two competitors
could learn a lot from each other.</p>
