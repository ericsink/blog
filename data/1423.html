Thoughts on Apple's announcement today:  The new iMac looks cool, but I'm not sure it lives up to the pre-show hype.  They set our expectations higher, leading us to believe they were to announce something a lot more world-changing than a new computer.  I agree with others who think the product should have been called iHype.<br><br>
Still, they pulled off a very, very nice PR trick.  How many new computers get the cover of Time magazine?<br><br>
BTW, I think I'll end up buying one.  We're building a new house, and I think the new iMac design will look great on the desk in our kitchen.  <tt>:-)</tt>
