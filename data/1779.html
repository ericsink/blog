<p>Hey folks, I just wanted to let my readers know that I'll be
at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention (<a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010">OSCON</a>)
a couple weeks from now in Portland, Oregon.&nbsp; SourceGear will have an exhibitor
booth with, as usual, the very coolest free T-shirts.</p>

<p>Stop by and say hello!&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
