<p>After years of refusing requests from people want my blog to
support comments, I have decided to give it a try.&nbsp; I'm using <a
href="http://www.haloscan.com/">Haloscan</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my comment policy:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >I reserve the right to change my mind and go back to having
     no comments at all.</li>
 <li >I'm not promising to respond to comments.</li>
 <li >I reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason.</li>
 <li >The likelihood of your comment being deleted will be
     dramatically higher if any of the following conditions apply:</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li >Your comment is anonymous.</li>
  <li >Your comment contains language I wouldn't want my
      daughters to see.</li>
  <li >Your comment is off-topic.</li>
  <li >Your comment is complaining about the deletion of another
      comment.</li>
  <li >You are a Kansas basketball fan.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></li>
 </ol>
 <li >This comment policy is subject to change at my whim.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that each article here only supports comments when I
specifically enable the feature for that entry.&nbsp; I'm doing this for selected
posts from the past, but not all of them.</p>

<p>Update:&nbsp; I'm getting feedback from people who don't like the
fact that my comment links use Javascript.&nbsp; Sorry, that's how Haloscan works,
or at least, that's how it works for blogs like mine where all the content is
static HTML.</p>
