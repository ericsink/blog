Johnson </A>was one of my favorite professors at UIUC.&nbsp; Nowadays he 
sometimes invites his alumni back to speak to his Senior Projects class.&nbsp; 
The topic is always the same:&nbsp; "What I Wish I Knew When I Graduated".&nbsp; 
I've done this gig several times and it's always fun.&nbsp; I'm speaking to the 
class again today.&nbsp; My slides (PowerPoint format) are 
attached.</P>
