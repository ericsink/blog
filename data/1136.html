<p>I don't believe in frequent price changes.</p>
<p>I also don't believe in waiting to fix a mistake.</p>
<p>These two beliefs came into conflict for me today, and I made a choice.&nbsp; I have changed the price of Winnable Solitaire from $12 to $7.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that I only released this product 3 days ago.&nbsp; In golf, we call this a <a href="http://golf.about.com/cs/historyofgolf/a/hist_mulligan.htm">mulligan</a>.</p>
<p>However, this product is an experiment.&nbsp; It is an opportunity learn, an opportunity to try things which might otherwise be a bad idea.&nbsp; I'm allowing myself a mulligan or two.</p>
<p>It is already clear that I would rather err too low on price than too high.&nbsp; I may raise the cost later when I release new versions with more features.&nbsp; For now, I don't want the price to be an obstacle for anyone who likes the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also fixed a minor bug in the display of empty card piles.</p>
