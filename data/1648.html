<p>Nick, <a
href="http://blogs.codegear.com/nickhodges/archive/2006/12/20/30787.aspx">this</a>
is simply unfair.</p>

<p>So the idea here is that I'm supposed to post five things
about myself that most people don't know, and then tag five more people to keep
the game moving.&nbsp; Nick Hodges tagged me.</p>

<p>The problem is that Nick's five things are <i>really</i>
cool.&nbsp; He piloted a jet.&nbsp; He met the vice president.&nbsp; He has a BA in classical
languages.</p>

<p>I've been trying to think of five things about myself that
won't be completely mundane compared to Nick's five, but that's just not gonna
happen.</p>

<p>It's tempting to just pull a <a
href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/01/01/one-thing-i-hope-dies-in-2007/">Scoble</a>
and declare this meme to be "stupid".</p>

<p>Oh well, here goes:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >I have never smoked a cigarette.</li>
 <li >I am a classically trained vocalist.</li>
 <li >During high school I lettered in tennis.</li>
 <li >I failed a class in college (DiffEq).</li>
 <li >Shooting clay pigeons with a shotgun, I once hit 30 in a
     row.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there you have it.</p>

<p>OK, I'm supposed to tag five more people, right?&nbsp; I tag my
coworkers <a href="http://ianolsen.wordpress.com/">Ian</a>, <a
href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/">Ed</a> and <a
href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/">Martin</a>.</p>

<p>And I also tag <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/">Eric Rudder</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a>.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
