I just posted the following remarks to a discussion Slashdot:<br><br>
Eventually the CLR will replace Microsoft's platform revenue stream. <br><br>

Right now they get a nice chunk of money every time somebody buys a PC. Windows is one of the most expensive components of a desktop computer. <br><br>

If you look far enough down the road, Linux on the desktop is a reality. So they know that the OS monopoly is coming to an end. It is time to start getting a new monopoly ready to take its place. <br><br>

They will ride this gravy train as long as they can, and then they will concede the OS market and start charging the same per-computer tax for the CLR. They won't care what OS is running underneath it. The OS will become a low-margin commodity, and they may even just starting giving Windows away for free. The profit margins will simply be relocated upward to a higher layer of this new and thicker notion of a platform. <br><br>

BTW, don't even think about suggesting that Java will win because it was here first. Java is to the CLR as Lotus-1-2-3 was to Excel. Some people innovate. Other people specialize in refinement and broad market penetration.
BTW, my remarks about the CLR are intended to be more admiring than pejorative.  We're committed to the .NET platform, and I really like C#.
