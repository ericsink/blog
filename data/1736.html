<p>It's hard to decide how afraid to be of something that is
really bad and really rare.</p>

<p>This problem is currently one of the most controversial
issues in the United States.&nbsp; Ever since <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks">September 11,
2001</a>, we have been wrestling with the question: How afraid of terrorism
should we be?</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >We all agree that terrorism is really bad.&nbsp; What happened
     on 9/11 was awful.</li>
 <li >But it's also really rare.&nbsp; I personally have never met a
     Muslim who wanted to hurt me.</li>
</ul>

<p>How afraid should we be?&nbsp; </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >Some people are very afraid.&nbsp; They focus more on the
     &quot;really bad&quot; side of the issue.&nbsp; Many of these folks are willing
     to give up their own civil liberties just to feel safer.&nbsp; </li>
 <li >Others are not afraid at all.&nbsp; They focus more on the
     &quot;really rare&quot; side of the issue.&nbsp; They prefer to spend their
     resources and attention in other areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog entry is not the place for me to take a stance on
any of these issues.&nbsp; For now I will simply say that I understand both
perspectives. &nbsp;This whole situation is simply the most obvious example of my
point, which was:</p>

<p>It's hard to decide how afraid to be of something that is
really bad and really rare.</p>

<p>Issues like these are like an icy ski slope.&nbsp; Some people
stand at the top.&nbsp; Some people stand at the bottom.&nbsp; Very few people stand
anywhere else.&nbsp; It's too slippery.</p>

<p>It is perhaps interesting to note that these issues can be equally
polarizing when the context is far less important, like the digital world.&nbsp;
Granted, the underlying topics are far less weighty.&nbsp; When discussing things
like terrorism or child abduction, the definition of "really bad" is quite
different than it is when talking about music piracy or vandalized Wikipedia
entries.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Still, the polarizing effect looks exactly the same.&nbsp; It's
hard to decide how afraid to be of something that is really bad and really
rare.&nbsp; Some people stand at the top of the slope.&nbsp; Others stand at the bottom.</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>I don't know anybody who has lukewarm feelings about
Wikipedia.&nbsp; Folks either love it or they hate it.</p>

<p>My daughter's school teacher hates it.&nbsp; Wikipedia can
provide no claims of accuracy.&nbsp; There is no good way to be sure that the
information is correct.&nbsp; When it's not correct, there is either no one to blame
or no way to punish them.&nbsp; All of these are crucial attributes of a traditional
encyclopedia.</p>

<p>I understand this perspective, but on this particular issue,
I'm standing at the top of the slope.&nbsp; I love Wikipedia.&nbsp; The principle is just
very appealing:&nbsp; The distinction between reader and writer is largely removed.&nbsp;
Anyone can add or change the content.&nbsp; Since the good guys far outnumber the
bad guys, the result is a body of content which is constantly growing and
improving.</p>

<p>(It's kind of the same principle as <a
href="{{{link:id='1176'}}}">Career Calculus</a>, except
for an encyclopedia.&nbsp; Focus on the first derivative.&nbsp; Instead of worrying about
how good the encyclopedia is now, worry about whether it is getting better and
how that's happening.)</p>

<p>I admit that there are obvious risks.&nbsp; Since anybody can
edit a Wikipedia page, it is always possible for the content of a page to be
incorrect or even vandalized.</p>

<p>But the tradeoff seems to work well in practice.&nbsp; I probably
use Wikipedia every day.&nbsp; The information I find there has been consistently
helpful.&nbsp; I like Wikipedia better than a traditional encyclopedia.&nbsp; Much
better.</p>

<p>But maybe this is because the threat isn't very real to me.&nbsp;
Personally, I have never encountered a vandalized Wikipedia article.&nbsp;
Occasionally I find an entry which is lame, but I don't remember seeing one
that was blatantly wrong or intentionally damaged.&nbsp; Most of the time, the
content in Wikipedia is excellent.</p>

<p>But the fact remains:&nbsp; Every time I use Wikipedia, I am
taking a risk.&nbsp; Since I have never gotten burned by that risk, the peril
doesn't seem very real.</p>

<h3>The Peril is Real</h3>

<p>Wikipedia currently has an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Sink">entry about me</a>.&nbsp; This
morning, my 10-year-old daughter told me that she tried to edit that entry. &nbsp;Suddenly
my entire perspective on Wikipedia changed.&nbsp; This was the first time I had to
confront the idea of a vandalized Wikipedia entry in any sort of real way.</p>

<p>As it turns out, she didn't succeed.&nbsp; But she's a very
bright young lady, so I'm sure she'll figure it out soon.</p>

<p>As a matter of principle, I refuse to edit my own Wikipedia
page.&nbsp; So, I have a favor to ask of my readers.</p>

<p>Sometime soon my Wikipedia entry is going to change.&nbsp; Any
content about SourceGear, AbiWord or Spyglass will be deleted.&nbsp; The new version
of the article will focus primarily on my atrocious failings as a father,
evidenced by my ongoing refusal to allow my youngest daughter to get a hamster.</p>

<p>When this happens, could one of you folks fix it for me?&nbsp;
Thanks.</p>
