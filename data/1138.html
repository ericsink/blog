<p>This is <strong>way</strong> off-topic.</p>
<p>It happened very much like the stories I've heard before.&nbsp;&nbsp;On <a href="http://www.dtpd.org/pages/hole4.html">hole #4</a> at Randall Oaks golf course, I hooked my first shot badly to the left on a par 4 which doglegs sharply to the right.&nbsp; The ball struck a fence and barely stayed in play.</p>
<p>I smacked my second shot hard with a 3-iron.&nbsp; It went straight as an arrow, but I was sure I had used too much club.&nbsp; I spent several minutes looking for the ball behind the green.&nbsp; The course was crowded so I gave up, dropped a ball, and chipped on.</p>
<p>As I removed the flag for putting, I found my lost ball, sitting right there in the cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 175 yards out, I had holed my 3-iron for an eagle 2.</p>
<p>I concede the shot was mostly luck.&nbsp; I'm still a bad golfer.&nbsp; I may be the only golfer on earth who has made an eagle but never made a birdie.</p>
<p>But I'm gloating anyway.</p>
