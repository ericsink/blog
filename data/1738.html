<p><a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">SD West</a> is next week
and SourceGear has a whole bunch of stuff happening:</p>

<h3>Fortress 1.1 and Vault 4.1</h3>

<p>We like to use trade shows as a public debut of new
products.&nbsp; Last week <a

"dot one" <a
href="http://blog.roub.net/2008/02/vault_41_and_fortress_11_released.html">releases</a>
of <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">Vault</a> and <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/fortress/index.html">Fortress</a>.&nbsp; SD West
will be our first opportunity to talk with customers in person about these new
versions.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Interactions like these are a big part of what makes a trade
show trip worthwhile for us.&nbsp; The business of software can be so impersonal.&nbsp;
Software flows out our T1 line.&nbsp; Money flows in.&nbsp; I love trade shows because
they're a place where customers are not just rows in a database.&nbsp; People stop
by and tell us they love our product.&nbsp; We thank them.&nbsp; People come and tell us
we disappointed them.&nbsp; We listen.</p>

<p>But mostly, people come and ask us what's new.&nbsp; We show
them.&nbsp; And their reactions are some of the best product feedback we get.</p>

<p>Fortress 1.1 and Vault 4.1 have some cool new stuff.&nbsp; Here's
a shot of the new "tag cloud" feature in Fortress:</p>

<p>Come see us in booth 308 next week and we'll show you.</p>

<h3>T-Shirts and Comic Books</h3>

<p><img width=114 height=174 src="{{{link:id='2090'}}}"
align=right hspace=12>Continuing our <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/TEM/index.html">Evil Mastermind</a> theme, we
have arranged to have a comic book placed in the conference bag for every
attendee.</p>

<p>We also have a new edition of the Evil Mastermind T-shirt.&nbsp;
We're bringing a thousand of them to give away in our booth.</p>

<h3><br clear=all>
Beat Jeremy at Guitar Hero</h3>

<p><img width=201 height=201 src="{{{link:id='2091'}}}"
align=left hspace=12>The other tenants in our office building don't have any
idea what we do.&nbsp; They refer to SourceGear as "that company with a pool table
up on the top floor".</p>

<p>I wonder what those folks would have said about the <a
href="{{{link:id='1562'}}}">company HORSE games</a> we
used to have at our previous location.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>

<p>Anyway, I strongly believe that a little recreation is a
critical part of the culture of any good software company.</p>

<p>These days, the popular place to be at SourceGear is the room
with the video game consoles hooked up to the plasma TV.&nbsp; It turns out that our
development team lead is pretty darn good at Guitar Hero.&nbsp; In fact, he will be <a
href="http://vaultblog.sourcegear.com/articles/2008/02/12/sourcegear-at-sdwest">taking
on all challengers</a> in our booth at SD West next week.&nbsp; We'll give a 5-user
Fortress license to anyone who can beat him.</p>

<h3><br clear=all>
Evil Mastermind guitar</h3>

<p><img width=164 height=203 src="{{{link:id='2092'}}}"
align=right hspace=12>And if we're going to play Guitar Hero, why not have the
real thing as well?&nbsp; On the last day of the show we will have a prize drawing
for an Evil Mastermind electric guitar.&nbsp; It's a Schecter PT, and the customization
work was professionally done.&nbsp; I saw this instrument yesterday, and it looks
really sweet.&nbsp; For more details, see <a

<h3><br clear=all>
My panel session on Friday</h3>

<p><img width=144 height=144 src="{{{link:id='2093'}}}"
align=left hspace=12>Friday morning at the conference I will be moderating a
panel discussion.&nbsp; It's in the <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2008/west/biz.htm">Business
of Software track</a>, and the topic is Private Company Exit Strategies.</p>

<h3><br clear=all>
The Jolt Awards</h3>

<p><img width=139 height=109 src="{{{link:id='2094'}}}"
align=right hspace=12>We are honored that SourceGear <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html">DiffMerge</a> has
been chosen as one of the Jolt Award <a
href="http://www.joltawards.com/finalists.html">finalists</a> this year.&nbsp; We'll
be there at the announcement ceremony March 5<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; The competition in
our category looks really tough, but somebody's gonna win, so we're hoping it's
us.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
