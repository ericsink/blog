<p>So last week while I was in Madrid, Borland finally
announced what they're doing with "DevCo".&nbsp; Instead of selling their dev tools
division, they are spinning it out into a wholly owned subsidiary called
CodeGear.</p>

<p>People keep asking me for my reaction to this news,
especially because the name is so obviously similar to SourceGear.</p>

<p>Actually, I have a bunch of different thoughts.&nbsp; So, in the
spirit of my favorite scene from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093886/">Roxanne</a>,
here are twenty possible reactions I could offer:</p>

  <p>Hmmm.&nbsp; I've been waiting for the DevCo spinoff, expecting
  it to be a company with whom SourceGear would want to partner (whereas
  Borland really isn't).&nbsp; But now, the similarity of the two names makes me
  pause and think. &nbsp;If SourceGear and CodeGear were working together on
  something, wouldn't that merely increase the confusion?</p>

  <p>Welcome [back] to the world of selling products for

  <p>Regardless of what the new company is called, I still
  think it was a big mistake to stir the .NET stuff into the Delphi soup.&nbsp; It's
  great that CodeGear is focused on developers, but that focus still isn't sharp

  and prune everything that doesn't fit.</p>
