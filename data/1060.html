<h2>Beyond CheckOut and CheckIn</h2>
<font size=2>26 Jun 2003</font><p>

<P>Many&nbsp;people use only a small portion of the features of the version 
control system.&nbsp; If you use little more than checkout and checkin, you 
might actually be in the majority.&nbsp; A Vault user recently asked me to 
explain why anyone would use things like Share, Branch, Label, Cloak, and Merge 
Branch Into Trunk.&nbsp; I had fun writing my response, so I thought I would 
re-post it here.&nbsp; Beware, this writeup doesn't even attempt to be objective 
about which version control product is most neato.<img src="smiley.gif"></P>
<P>The "more advanced" features exist for teams and projects which are, er, more 
advanced.&nbsp; The bigger your team, the bigger your company, the more stuff 
you have going on, then the more powerful you want your SCM tool to be.</P>
<P>Even still,&nbsp; I've run across teams of significant size who prefer to use 
only the basics.&nbsp; The truth is that concurrent development is hard. Good 
SCM tools make it easier, but some people prefer to adopt processes which 
prevent complexity instead of using tools which help manage complexity.</P>
<P>But for those who dare, good version control systems offer several ways to 
maintain your sanity even while lots of things are going on at one time.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Label</FONT></P>
<P>The most painless feature on your list is Label. Labels are conceptually very 
simple and are used by most teams.&nbsp; A label is used to mark a specific 
version of a file or a group of files.&nbsp; It is typical to apply a label when 
a project milestone is reached. A label is often applied when an important build 
is made, thus making it easier to retrieve the exact source code which 
corresponds to that build. In other SCM tools, labels are sometimes called 
"tags".</P>
<P>As I've mentioned before, Vault's labels are a little different from 
SourceSafe's labels because they appear as just another folder in the repository 
hierarchy.&nbsp; A label is used to remember a snapshot of time in the history 
of your tree, so Vault presents that snapshot as a tree.&nbsp; In SourceSafe, a 
label is merely a string which is associated with a set of versions of 
items.&nbsp; The use cases remain the same.</P>
<P>Suppose you've been working for months to deliver a beta to your 
customers.&nbsp; When you finally reach completion, you build your beta 
release.&nbsp; You want to remember exactly what the state of your repository 
was at the moment you reached beta, so you create a Label.&nbsp; You can later 
fetch the files from that Label and you will get the same versions you used to 
build your beta release.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Cloak</FONT></P>
<P>Another rather painless feature on your list is Cloak.&nbsp; This one is 
actually even simpler.&nbsp; Cloak allows you to hide folders you don't care 
about. The folder is still there, but you no longer have to deal with it.&nbsp; 
For example, assume you have a big folder hierarchy.&nbsp; Three levels down, 
your marketing people placed a folder containing a whole bunch of enormous TIFF 
images.&nbsp; Developers don't want to be retrieving this stuff every time they 
do a get-latest operation.&nbsp; Luckily they can just cloak that folder and 
Vault will pretend it's not there.&nbsp; Cloak is a personal feature.&nbsp; When 
you cloak a folder, you hide it from yourself, but others can still see it.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Share</FONT></P>
<P>Taking a step up the stairway of complexity we come to Share.&nbsp; This 
feature allows a folder or file to appear in multiple places in the 
repository.&nbsp; For you Unix-heads out there, Share is somewhat like a file 
system link.</P>
<P>For example, suppose your team's projects are in $/blue and another team in 
your company stores their work in $/red.&nbsp; They have a library in 
$/red/turboLib that you want to use, but you don't want to constantly be 
fetching everything else in $/red.&nbsp; So, you Share $/red and make it appear 
as $/blue/red/shares/turboLib. Now, the following two repository paths actually 
point to the same folder:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>$/red/turboLib<BR>$/blue/red/shares/turboLib</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Any change to one of these folders will automatically appear in the 
other.&nbsp; They are not copies of each other. Rather, there is only one 
instance of the folder, and it simply shows up in two different places.</P>
<P>Note that Vault's share command works considerably better than SourceSafe 
because folders can be shared, not just files.&nbsp; When you share a folder in 
SourceSafe, it just recursively shares every folder inside.&nbsp; If this 
example were done in SourceSafe, then $/blue/red/shares/turboLib would simply be 
a set of new folders which contain a bunch of files which are individually 
shared with their counterparts back in $/red/...&nbsp; However, the folders 
themselves are distinct.&nbsp; After the Share is created, if you add a file to 
$/red/turboLib, that new file will not automatically appear in 
$/blue/red/shares/turboLib. With Vault, the added file does appear, because the 
folders themselves are shared, not just the files.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Pin</FONT></P>
<P>You didn't ask about Pin, but it deserves to be mentioned here.&nbsp; Pin is 
handy when you have shared something but you want to freeze it.&nbsp; Let's say 
that you've been happily benefiting from the excellent efforts of the red team 
and you're very happy with how turboLib is working out for your project.&nbsp; 
Every time they checkin a change to turboLib, it magically becomes part of your 
tree as well.&nbsp; Suddenly one Friday, the manager of the red team decides 
that the fridge in their building will from now on be stocked with free beer for 
all the programmers.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the quality of turboLib starts 
going down.&nbsp; You are no longer quite as happy with the Share you 
established.</P>
<P>So, you bring up the Show History window and Pin $/blue/red/shares/turboLib 
to the version which existed on that fateful Friday.&nbsp; The red team can 
continue their "work" in $/red/turboLib, but your side of the share link will no 
longer automatically get their changes.&nbsp; It has been frozen at a Friday in 
the past.&nbsp; If you later Unpin that folder, the Share will become alive 
again.&nbsp; As long as your folder is pinned, you can't make any changes in 
it.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Branch</FONT></P>
<P>This brings us to the topic of Branching.&nbsp; This is the most advanced of 
the features you mentioned.&nbsp; Suppose you have a folder in which development 
is going on, but you want to start a second development effort using that same 
folder.&nbsp; You want the two efforts to be separate, even if you eventually 
want them to be one again. What you want is a branch.</P>
<P>Returning once again to my Share example, let's assume that after several 
weeks of the party life, the red team doesn't seem to be returning to 
normal.&nbsp; Pin has shielded you from their rather questionable checkins to 
turboLib, but now you need more.&nbsp; You need bugfixes in turboLib.&nbsp; It's 
time to take matters into your own hands and start maintaining your own version 
of turboLib.&nbsp; It's time to Branch.</P>
<P>You can branch at any version you like.&nbsp; In this case, you want to 
branch back on that freaky Friday when the red team began its decline. Those 
versions, the same ones you've held pinned for the last several weeks, will be 
the initial contents of your branch, which you create at 
$/blue/red/forks/turboLib.</P>
<P>There continues to be a relationship between $/blue/red/forks/turboLib and 
$/red/turboLib. They share all their history prior to that Friday.&nbsp; But 
after that Friday they diverge. Changes to one folder do not appear in the 
other.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sansserif size=4>Merge Branches</FONT></P>
<P>Now let's say that the manager of the red team leaves and the new manager is 
horrified to find beer in the fridge.&nbsp; The beer is removed and the red team 
gradually regains its capacity for consecutive thought.&nbsp; Suddenly the red 
and blue versions of turboLib might seem a little too detached.&nbsp; The blue 
team has made changes which the newly coherent red team finds desirable.&nbsp; 
Similarly the red team is now beginning to improve turboLib again, leading the 
blue team to become interested in their new changes as well.</P>
<P>What these two teams need is the ability to migrate changes back and 
forth.&nbsp; This feature can go by different names.&nbsp; Vault and SourceSafe 
call it "Merge Branches".&nbsp; The basic idea is that the user can review 
changes to either folder and choose to apply those changes to the other 
folder.&nbsp; The SCM tool tries to make this process as painless as 
possible.</P>
<P>Different SCM tools handle branch merging in different ways.&nbsp; Suffice it 
to say that the topic is extremely complex.&nbsp; A truly powerful 
implementation can require years of development.</P>
<P>The branch merging support in Vault 1.0 is not as powerful as the more mature 
players in the SCM market.&nbsp; For example, Vault 1.0 can merge in only one 
direction, from the branch back into its trunk.&nbsp; In my example, Vault 1.0 
would only be able to merge from the blue version of turboLib back into the red 
version.&nbsp; But we have clear plans and designs to keep improving our branch 
merging in future releases.</P>
<P>And even though Vault 1.0's branch merging is not the most powerful 
implementation, it may be one of the easiest to use.&nbsp; We implemented this 
feature as a wizard which walks the user through the process step by step.&nbsp; 
Our goal was to make branching less "scary", and we plan to maintain that value 
as the feature becomes more powerful later.</P>
