<p>I am delighted to announce that SourceGear has released
version 5.1 of Vault, our version control tool for developers on Windows and
Visual Studio.&nbsp; This is technically a minor release, and it does contain the
"lots of little improvements" which are usually found in a "dot one release", but
it also brings two big changes.</p>

<p>First of all, we are renaming our "Fortress" product and
calling it Vault Professional Edition.&nbsp; Fortress has always been "a version of
Vault with more features", but the naming caused some confusion.&nbsp; We decided to
simplify things and make the naming consistent with what these products really
are:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li ><a href="http://sourcegear.com/vault/index.html">Vault
     Standard</a> (formerly called just "Vault") is our entry-level offering,
     still the best replacement for SourceSafe.</li>
 <li ><a href="http://sourcegear.com/vaultpro/index.html">Vault
     Pro</a> (formerly called "Fortress") is Vault with more features,
     including work item tracking and more support for integration with
     products from other vendors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second major change in the 5.1 release is that Vault Pro
supports integration with OnTime from <a href="http://www.axosoft.com/">Axosoft</a>.&nbsp;
Our two companies have many common customers who have been asking for Vault and
OnTime to work better together.&nbsp; I consider OnTime to be an outstanding
product, and I'm glad that development teams who use OnTime with Vault can
enjoy a much-improved user experience.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

<p>Plans for the Vault 6.0 release are already under way.&nbsp; We
intend to publish a roadmap with planned features and general timeframe as soon
as we can.&nbsp; Once it's available, you'll see it here.</p>
