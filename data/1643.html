<p>In today's Wall Street Journal, Robert Scoble and Dave Winer
are <a

the question of whether Microsoft is innovative or not.&nbsp; Winer says "Microsoft
isn't an innovator, and never was".&nbsp; Scoble's argument doesn't appear to offer
the same kid of juicy sound bite that begs to be ripped out of context, but he
generally seems to be defending Microsoft as an innovator. </p>

<p>Don Dodge <a
href="http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2006/12/is_microsoft_dr.html">chimes
in</a>, saying that "they both missed the point".&nbsp; His claim rests on his
quibbles over the misuse of the words "innovation" and "invention".&nbsp; He backs
up his argument by offering definitions for both words, but as far as I can
tell he made those definitions up.&nbsp; They bear little or no resemblance to
anything I can find in my copy of Webster's Tenth Edition.&nbsp; Anyway, Dodge goes
on to say that Microsoft should be getting credit for both invention and
innovation.</p>

<p>Scoble is an ex-Microsoftie.&nbsp; Dodge is currently with
Microsoft.&nbsp; AFAIK, Winer has never worked for Microsoft.</p>

<p>All three of these guys have some smart things to say on the
topic, but if I have to choose, I'll side with Dave Winer.&nbsp; I personally don't think
of Microsoft as an innovative company.&nbsp; I think of Microsoft as a company with
outstanding execution, not outstanding innovation.</p>

<p>But to me the more important question is, "Who cares?"&nbsp; When
I say Microsoft is not innovative, I am not making a pejorative statement.&nbsp; Rather,
I am wondering why Microsoft would even <i>want</i> to be innovative.</p>

<p>Microsoft is a public company.&nbsp; They exist for the purpose
of generating profit for their shareholders.&nbsp; The truth is that the link between
innovation and profit is weak at best.&nbsp; Innovation is not the usual path to
making a lot of money.&nbsp; Most people don't buy innovative products.&nbsp; They buy
proven solutions which have matured a bit further and are ready for the
mainstream.</p>

<p>Taking technologies through this maturing process is
difficult and fraught with risk.&nbsp; Microsoft offers a huge number of cool products
that people really want, and they do it better than anybody else.&nbsp; If those
products don't inspire people to think of Microsoft as innovative, who cares?</p>

<p>Microsoft apparently cares a lot.&nbsp; They seem to want the
world to see them as innovative.&nbsp; Scoble and Dodge are not the first
Microsofties to get all fussy on this issue.&nbsp; But why?</p>

<p>I think Microsoft knows that innovation usually does not lead
to profit, but it <i>does</i> lead to admiration.&nbsp; People admire innovators, and
Microsoft wants to be admired.</p>

<p>But now it's time for <i>my</i> point:&nbsp; If Microsoft really wants
to be admired, I think they should stop complaining that people don't admire them
and start acting admirably.</p>

<p>Need an example?&nbsp; Last week, Microsoft announced a <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/21/licensing-the-2007-microsoft-office-user-interface.aspx">licensing
program</a> for their "intellectual property" associated with the ribbon
feature in Office 2007.&nbsp; Now, I'll be the first to say that there are some cool
things here.&nbsp; The ribbon concept itself is cool.&nbsp; The license is apparently
free of cost, which is cool.</p>

<p>But the un-cool part is the complete absence of information
about what intellectual property rights are being licensed.&nbsp; They explicitly
say that there is no code being licensed, so what IP am I getting when I sign
this license?</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >It can't be a trademark.</li>
 <li >Is it a copyright?&nbsp; If so, why do they apparently think
     that "look and feel" copyrights are enforceable when legal precedent
     suggests otherwise?&nbsp; </li>
 <li >Is it a trade secret?&nbsp; In other words, are licensees
     simply obtaining access to the document which describes all the guidelines
     for how a ribbon should work?&nbsp; If so, why is Microsoft saying that anybody
     who uses a ribbon needs a license?</li>
 <li >Is it a patent?&nbsp; Then why not say so?</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not clear.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> clear is that if you use a
ribbon-like concept in your app but choose not to sign this license, you take
the risk of being sued by Microsoft.&nbsp; But since you don't know what the basis
of that lawsuit will be, you have no objective information on which to base
your decision.&nbsp; All you know is that an enormous and powerful company is making
subtle threats.&nbsp; And that's scary. </p>

<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; This smells like a company using fear to
manipulate people.&nbsp; And nobody admires someone who applies fear for the purpose
of coercion.</p>

<p>The ribbon issue happens to be the situation that has me
annoyed at the moment, but this is just one example of Microsoft acting in a
way that leads people to not admire them.&nbsp; There are plenty of other examples I
could cite.&nbsp; Sum it all up and you have one big dissonant noise:&nbsp; Microsoft
says they want to be admired, but sometimes their actions indicate that they
want profit a lot more than they want admiration.</p>

<p>My regular readers know that I generally consider myself to
be a fan of Microsoft's products and technologies.&nbsp; That hasn't changed.</p>

<p>I am also not saying I disapprove of Microsoft as a basically
profit-driven corporation.</p>

<p>I just wish they'd stop expecting people to admire them.</p>

<p>Microsoft reminds me of an IRS auditor who is whining that
he doesn't have any friends.</p>
