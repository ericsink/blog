<p><i>Looking for a Wii?&nbsp; Try <a

<p>One of my coworkers got a Wii and brought it to the office.&nbsp;
I was hooked.</p>

<p>At first I didn't realize how difficult it was to buy a
Wii.&nbsp; I simply knew that I wanted one.&nbsp; After several silly and futile attempts
to find one in a retail store, I started thinking about other means.</p>

<p>Using the "advanced search" feature on eBay, I found
somebody selling a Wii here in my town.&nbsp; The seller and I agreed to meet in
person and close the deal with cash.&nbsp; He told me to be at a specific place on
the University of Illinois campus, between two buildings, at 6:30pm.</p>

<p>I arrived at the designated location on time, but the seller
wasn't there.&nbsp; As I stood around waiting, I realized I was standing in a dark
alley at night with a roll of twenty dollar bills waiting for somebody I had
never seen before.&nbsp; The whole thing was kind of creepy.</p>

<p>Around 6:45, a guy walked into the alley carrying a shopping
bag.&nbsp; I knew at a glance that it was the seller.&nbsp; </p>

<p>He brought a goon with him, apparently for protection.&nbsp; The
goliath was about nine feet tall and seemed like the sort of guy who could take
the life of another human being in a completely nonchalant fashion.&nbsp; He was
wearing a t-shirt which had some stains I assumed to be the blood from the
previous victim of their scam.</p>

<p>When they walked into the alley, the seller looked me over.&nbsp;
Staring coldly at me, he took out a mobile phone and dialed the number I had
given him.&nbsp; When the phone in my hand rang loudly, he walked over, opened the
bag, and said, "Here it is."</p>

<p>The goon grunted.&nbsp; Or growled.&nbsp; I couldn't tell which.</p>

<p>I suddenly wished I had brought my own goon.&nbsp; The idea never
even occurred to me, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway.&nbsp; Everyone I know is
short and capable of speech.</p>

<p>I asked the seller, "Do you mind if I take a look at it?"</p>

<p>He sneered, "Do you mind if I see the money?"</p>

<p>I traded him the wad of bills for the shopping bag.&nbsp; While
he counted his loot, I opened the Wii box, glancing at the goon every so often
and wondering if I had enough life insurance.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be in order.&nbsp; I said so, and they
walked away without another word.&nbsp; I watched for a moment, just to see if
perhaps the seller would pull a turkey drumstick out of his coat and throw it
to the goon as a treat.</p>

<p>I don't even know the seller's name, but I take some comfort
in the fact that if I ever need to buy drugs or a gun or a Playstation 3, I
already know the routine.</p>
