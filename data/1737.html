<p>I know, I know.&nbsp; Pessimism just isn't very attractive.&nbsp; But
sometimes an optimist can't find anything to say.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a>
announced that they are being acquired by Nokia.&nbsp; I decided to simmer for a
couple weeks before making any comment, but my perspective has not changed.&nbsp; I
just can't see this as good news.&nbsp; Bluntly, I assume this will be the death of
Trolltech.</p>

<p>And that would be a shame.&nbsp; Trolltech is on my short list of
software companies that I admire.&nbsp; Their product, Qt, has an amazing
reputation.&nbsp; Technologically, it seems to be the top dog in a space which is
crowded with lots of people trying to offer solutions to a very tough set of
problems.&nbsp; Trolltech plays well with both the open source world and the
commercial world, and they make a heckuva lot of money doing it.&nbsp; I'm
impressed.</p>

<p>(But I still wish they would put the pricing back on their
website.&nbsp; Yep, the unnamed company in my <a
href="{{{link:id='1735'}}}">Sales Guy Tantrum</a> last
month was Trolltech.)</p>

<p>I have no affiliation with Trolltech (or Nokia).&nbsp; I am not
even a customer (of either one).&nbsp; As someone who is very interested in the
business of software, I just hate seeing a good software company morph into a
bad one. &nbsp;Nokia is a great company and I'll be happy to see them prove me
wrong, but in general, when a software company gets acquired by a non-software
company, it immediately begins a steep and steady decline.</p>

<p>Managing a software company, especially one that sells to
developers, is not like anything else.&nbsp; It's just different, and that's that.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li >If you're great at the business of software, there's an
     excellent chance you would be incompetent as a business manager in any other
     field.</li>
 <li >Similarly, anybody who is excellent in another field is
     almost certainly going to struggle if they take the reins of a software
     venture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nokia is a great cell phone company.&nbsp; None of their skills
are going to apply very well to the development, maintenance, marketing and
sales of a C++ portability framework.</p>

<p>So maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit, but I like to beat the
rush.&nbsp; I'm ready now to mourn the loss of Trolltech, yet another great software
company destroyed by a BigCo who assumed that managing a software business should
be easy.</p>

<p>If I'm wrong, tell me why.</p>
