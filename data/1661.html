<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>SourceGear released Vault 3.5.2
today (<a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads.html">downloads page</a>).&nbsp;
The previous current version of Vault was 3.5.1, so this is what we call a
maintenance release.&nbsp; However, this is a very <i>special</i> maintenance
release.&nbsp; You can read the full <a
href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/releases/3.5.2.html">release notes</a> if
you like, but I want to highlight a few reasons why this new version is a big
deal.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>First of all, version 3.5.2
introduces a number of small things:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>We added official support for
     Windows Vista and the x64 versions of Windows.&nbsp; </li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>We fixed some quirky behavior
     with Shadow Folders.&nbsp; </li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>We added a few little
     featurettes to the Vault GUI client.&nbsp; </li>
 <li  style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>We fixed some bugs in the
     MSSCCI (IDE integration) client.</li>
</ul>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>But the big news for 3.5.2 is a
bunch of performance and scalability improvements to the Vault server.&nbsp; All
three of the most common operations (Refresh, Check out and Commit) have been significantly
improved.&nbsp; In addition, Branch is now dramatically faster.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>As Vault has continued to mature
and grow in popularity, we have been attracting larger customers, sites with
hundreds of developers on a single Vault server.&nbsp; These improvements are going
to make an especially big difference for those users.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>I pause now for a moment to
think back to the beginning of this product.&nbsp; During the development of Vault
1.0, we were courting a customer who had about 70 developers on their team.&nbsp; We
lost that deal because our product wasn't ready for that kind of load.&nbsp; Today, over
four years later, I can feel confident in selling Vault to a team that is 10
times that size.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Note: &nbsp;I am not saying Vault is changing
to become an "Enterprise" product.&nbsp; We will continue to position Vault as a
product for the "Professional" tier, but the line between these two market
segments is not always clear.&nbsp; Microsoft defines the boundary at 500
developers, but there is some overlap in the way these customers buy tools.&nbsp;
Sometimes a company in the Professional segment will choose a more
Enterprise-oriented product like Microsoft Team Foundation Server or Rational
ClearCase.&nbsp; And sometimes an Enterprise company is looking for the
affordability and simplicity of a Professional tier product like Vault.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Bottom line:&nbsp; Our product got
better today.&nbsp; It's a good day.</p>
