<p>Once again, recruiting developers here on my blog has worked
out well for us.&nbsp; Our most recent <a
href="{{{link:id='1102'}}}">opening</a> has been
filled.&nbsp; Ben Pryor's first day is today.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As I write this, Ben is settling in to his office. &nbsp;Pity.&nbsp;
He won't be there long.&nbsp; We'll be moving into our new office space 39 days from
today.</p>
