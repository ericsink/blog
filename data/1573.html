<p>The hiring continues:&nbsp; Today is the first day for <a
href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/">Martin Woodward</a> with Teamprise.&nbsp; Martin
is English but he lives in Northern Ireland and will telecommute to Illinois.&nbsp; This will be our first experience having a core team member so far away.&nbsp; So far
so good:&nbsp; Our sysadmin guy set up the phone system so we can dial Martin's
extension just as if he were across the hall.&nbsp; <a href="http://asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a>
is <i>so</i> cool.</p>

<p>But this week Martin is here in Champaign and seems to be
showing great patience for the way all his new coworkers butcher the Queen's
English.&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
