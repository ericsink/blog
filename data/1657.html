<h3>Pi Day</h3>

<p>Is it just me or did "Pi Day" get a lot more publicity this
year than it has in the past?</p>

<p>And I'm not saying that's a good thing.&nbsp; When normal people
try to act like geeks the result looks just as dumb as when we try to look
normal.&nbsp; Case in point: &nbsp;On the local six o'clock news last night they did a
piece on "Pi Day".&nbsp; After the segment, the anchor rhetorically asked, "So does
anyone actually know what comes after 3.14?"</p>

<p>Suddenly, Neville the sports guy started rattling off
digits.&nbsp; You could tell the whole thing was unscripted, because it took half a
second for the camera to shift over to him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those digits were just plain wrong.&nbsp; You see,
30 years ago while Neville was playing shortstop for his little league team, I
was memorizing Pi.&nbsp; Trust me, Neville's ratio of circumference to diameter is a
recipe for all kinds of engineering disasters.</p>

<p>After the newscast, I asked my Labrador retriever to recite
Pi.&nbsp; She got the same number of digits correct as Neville did.</p>

<p>I don't go around trying to impress people with my athletic
abilities.&nbsp; Neville should stick to sports reporting.</p>

<h3>Call me "Coach Bolton"</h3>

<p>So I turned 39 years old today.&nbsp; That means I've got one
year left to do all the things I thought I would do before I was 40.&nbsp; I better
get busy.</p>

<p>As if I don't have enough reason to feel old today, this
afternoon I've got rehearsal for the school musical.&nbsp; Yes, you read that right
-- I'm in the school musical.&nbsp; My 7<sup>th</sup> grade daughter's school is
doing a production of Disney's "High School Musical".&nbsp; It's a school musical
about a school doing a school musical.&nbsp; I agreed to play the role of Coach
Bolton.&nbsp; I haven't done theatre in 20 years, but how could I turn down a recursive
musical?</p>

<p>The problem with rehearsal is that I am easily the oldest
person in the room.&nbsp; There will be 50 people in that auditorium and I will be
significantly older than the combined ages of any two others, including the
teacher who's directing the show.&nbsp; Oh well, at least I get to huff around and
overact.&nbsp; Character parts are fun.</p>

<h3>Fortress 1.0 Preview</h3>

<p>My birthday present from SourceGear today is the first
preview release of SourceGear Fortress.&nbsp; The bits are being finalized this
afternoon, but we'll let them cool over the weekend before releasing them to
the public.&nbsp; On Tuesday of next week, this early look at our new ALM
(Application Lifecycle Management) tool will be available for download on the
SourceGear website.&nbsp; As I always say, I <i>love</i> shipping software
products.&nbsp; Preview releases like this one are a step on the path, a sign that
we're getting close to the end of the cycle.</p>
