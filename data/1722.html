<p>I just read a really excellent book about sales.&nbsp; It's
called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684856018/sawdust08-20">Selling
the Wheel</a>.&nbsp; This book was recommended to me by Neil Davidson of <a
href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate</a>.</p>

<p>At first I didn't like it.&nbsp; After reading several chapters,
I was ready to email Neil and tell him he missed.&nbsp; But as I kept reading, I
started to understand where the book was headed.&nbsp; By the end, I was hooked.&nbsp;
This book is extremely good.</p>

<p>It's written in the form of a lighthearted story.&nbsp; I found
it to be a very easy and fun read, but it's also <i>very</i> thought provoking.</p>

<p>One of my favorite axioms of business is that context
determines strategy and tactics.&nbsp; As a company goes through the various stages
of its life, the stuff that works in one stage will probably produce failure in
the next.&nbsp; A bad idea now might very well be a good idea later.</p>

<p>It's easy to forget this when we are hiring.&nbsp; We go looking
for someone with experience in sales, marketing or project management.&nbsp; But in
what <i>context</i> did he or she gain that experience?&nbsp; Many successful people
think that there is exactly one best way to perform their job function.&nbsp; They
tried something.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; So they figure that's the right way to do it
every time.&nbsp; Very few people understand that there are several good ways to
approach their area of specialty, and the right way is determined by the
context.</p>

<p>It's the same problem with authors.&nbsp; Books on sales and
marketing fall into two categories:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li >Books that tell you the right way to do sales and
     marketing.<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li >Books that tell you lots of good ways to do sales and
     marketing and how to choose the right approach for your particular
     situation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Selling the Wheel is an example of the latter.</p>

<p>Anyway, great book.</p>

<p>BTW, you <i>are </i>going to Neil's <a
href="http://businessofsoftware.org/">conference</a> at the end of October,
right?&nbsp; <b>:-)</b></p>
