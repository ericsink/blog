4 items across in header links might still
be too wide for cell phone screens

fix basic aspects of style sheet to look like 
popular blogs.  font size, etc.

does google analytics still work?

which links are worth including in the lite header?

generate some kind of complete index?  so that robots
can find everything?

would be nice to get everything validating by xhtml.
so we could use xml reader to script changes.  want
each item to be loadable as an xml fragment, without
its template.  for the items with front matter anyway.
items without front matter, don't worry about.

hitting /vcbe yields error but vcbe/index.html works.
bucket config issue?

do we need separate style sheets for each template?

includes, like jekyll ?

what to do about the print- items?

link to blog repo on github, issues, pull requests,
etc

redo front page.  no more complete copies of
recent items?  each item appears on its own page.

responsive:  get rid of sidebar?  just a header
and footer?  progress on this with lite layout.

need link checking, for within-the-site links,
just to make sure they actually go somewhere.
need xhtml for this?

F# like C#

autogen dsl

viewmodels, but maybe not using the term
the way everyone else does.  all rx.

validators

layout completely separate layer

XF but mostly doesn't know, no XAML,
no binding

viewmodel invocations.  no implicit back
stack.  name + params.  params are checked
and type-checked.  catch errors earlier.

props with origins, merging, fix ordering
and race problems with init vs set

sqlite on the client, of course  :-)

postgres on the server

query server, subscribe to queries

state of each client db instance kept on server

scale out not up

websockets, persistent connections

other plain rest, but same msg format

DI, but plain, no container

testing with a fake implementation of XF

in rxui, everything is a prop first and reflection
is used to make it observable.  WhenAnyValue.  in my
approach, the observable is first-class and the prop
nature is secondary.
