switch to just two braces like jekyll/liquid?

fix rss generation.  how to get list of
articles?  use datefiled and tags, like before?

.ehtml suffix?  or just always look inside .html?
or .html.e ?

once everything with h is clean, commit c1
to the repo and deploy to s3

switch everything to path-absolute links,
beginning with a slash.  this will ruin the diffs,
causing every file to have minor changes.  basically,
just remove make_link, replacing it with the abs
path passed into it.  path of the source of the link
doesn't matter.

what to do about the print- items?

link to blog repo on github, issues, pull requests,
etc

redo front page.  no more complete copies of
recent items.  each item appears on its own page.

responsive:  get rid of sidebar?  just a header
and footer?

need link checking, for within-the-site links,
just to make sure they actually go somewhere

autogen dsl

viewmodels, but maybe not using the term
the way everyone else does.  all rx.

validators

layout completely separate layer

XF but mostly doesn't know, no XAML,
no binding

viewmodel invocations.  no implicit back
stack.  name + params.  params are checked
and type-checked.  catch errors earlier.

props with origins, merging, fix ordering
and race problems with init vs set

sqlite on the client, of course  :-)

postgres on the server

query server, subscribe to queries

state of each client db instance kept on server

scale out not up

websockets, persistent connections

other plain rest, but same msg format

DI, but plain, no container

testing with a fake implementation of XF

in rxui, everything is a prop first and reflection
is used to make it observable.  WhenAnyValue.  in my
approach, the observable is first-class and the prop
nature is secondary.
